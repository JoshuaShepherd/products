# AI Agent System for PDF Technical Document Conversion

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the AI Agent system designed to extract information from SpecChem's Technical Data Sheets (TDS) and Safety Data Sheets (SDS) in PDF format and populate the Supabase database. The system is built using OpenAI's Agent Builder and integrated with ChatKit for deployment, following a structured workflow without custom prompts in API routes.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PDF Extraction Chatbot** (`PDFExtractionChatbot.tsx`)
   - User interface for uploading PDF documents
   - Real-time processing feedback
   - Results display and interaction

2. **API Routes**
   - `/api/pdf-extract/upload` - Handles PDF file uploads
   - `/api/pdf-extract/process` - Processes PDFs with OpenAI Agent Builder

3. **Database Integration**
   - Supabase client for database operations
   - Product matching and update logic
   - Pictogram association management

4. **Agent Builder Integration**
   - OpenAI GPT-4o model for content analysis
   - Structured JSON response schema
   - Confidence scoring and quality assessment

## Workflow Process

### 1. Document Upload and Processing

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Uploads PDF] --> B[File Validation]
    B --> C[PDF to Text Conversion]
    C --> D[OpenAI Agent Analysis]
    D --> E[Product Matching]
    E --> F[Database Update/Create]
    F --> G[Results Display]
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **File Upload** (`/api/pdf-extract/upload/route.ts`)
   - Validates PDF file type and size (10MB limit)
   - Generates unique filename with UUID
   - Saves to `/uploads` directory
   - Returns file path for processing

2. **PDF Text Extraction** (`/api/pdf-extract/process/route.ts`)
   - Uses `pdftotext` command-line tool
   - Converts PDF to plain text
   - Validates text extraction success

3. **AI Analysis** (OpenAI Agent Builder)
   - Sends text to GPT-4o model
   - Uses structured prompt for data extraction
   - Returns JSON with extracted data and metadata

### 2. Product Matching Logic

The system implements a sophisticated product matching strategy:

#### Matching Strategies (in order of preference):

1. **Exact Name Match**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = 'extracted_name'
   ```

2. **Slug Match**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE slug = 'generated_slug'
   ```

3. **Case-Insensitive Match**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE name ILIKE 'extracted_name'
   ```

4. **Partial Match**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM products WHERE name ILIKE '%extracted_name%'
   ```

#### Product Matching Confidence Levels:

- **Exact**: Perfect name match
- **High**: Fuzzy match with >80% confidence
- **Medium**: Partial match with 60-80% confidence
- **Low**: Weak match with <60% confidence
- **None**: No match found

### 3. Data Extraction Schema

The Agent Builder uses a comprehensive JSON schema for data extraction:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "document_type": "TDS" | "SDS" | "BOTH" | "UNKNOWN",
    "product_name_extracted": "string",
    "extraction_confidence": "high" | "medium" | "low",
    "document_quality": "excellent" | "good" | "fair" | "poor",
    "flags": {
      "needs_manual_review": boolean,
      "has_ambiguities": boolean,
      "missing_critical_data": boolean
    }
  },
  "product_match": {
    "existing_product_id": "string" | null,
    "match_confidence": "exact" | "high" | "medium" | "low" | "none",
    "match_method": "name_exact" | "name_fuzzy" | "sku_match" | "slug_match",
    "action_required": "update" | "create" | "review" | "skip"
  },
  "extracted_data": {
    "product": { /* Product fields */ },
    "pictograms": [ /* Safety pictograms */ ],
    "category": { /* Product category */ }
  }
}
```

## Handling Existing Products with Incomplete Data

### Update Strategy

When a product exists but has incomplete fields, the system follows this approach:

1. **Field Comparison**
   - Compares extracted data with existing database entries
   - Identifies missing or incomplete fields
   - Preserves existing data unless new data is more complete

2. **Selective Updates**
   - Only updates fields with meaningful new data
   - Skips empty values and placeholder text
   - Maintains data integrity

3. **Update Logic** (from `scripts/import-sds-to-database.mjs`):
   ```javascript
   const fieldsToUpdate = [
     'signal_word',
     'hazard_statements', 
     'precautionary_statements',
     'response_statements',
     'components_determining_hazard',
     'first_aid',
     'storage',
     'disposal',
     'proper_shipping_name',
     'hazard_class',
     'packing_group'
   ];
   ```

4. **Data Validation**
   - Filters out empty values
   - Removes placeholder text ("NONE", "Not applicable")
   - Ensures minimum data quality thresholds

### Database Schema Integration

The system works with a comprehensive database schema:

#### Core Tables:

1. **products** - Main product information
2. **categories** - Product categorization
3. **pictograms** - Safety pictogram library (22 GHS pictograms)
4. **product_pictograms** - Many-to-many relationship

#### Key Product Fields:

- **Identification**: `name`, `slug`, `sku`, `category_id`
- **Descriptions**: Multi-language support (English, French, Spanish)
- **Technical Data**: `application`, `features`, `coverage`, `limitations`
- **Safety Information**: `signal_word`, `hazard_statements`, `precautionary_statements`
- **Transportation**: `proper_shipping_name`, `un_number`, `hazard_class`
- **Special Flags**: `do_not_freeze`, `mix_well`, `green_conscious`

## Safety Pictogram Processing

### Pictogram Identification

The system identifies applicable GHS pictograms based on hazard information:

1. **Hazard Analysis**
   - Analyzes signal words and hazard statements
   - Maps hazards to standard pictogram categories
   - Assigns confidence levels to pictogram matches

2. **Pictogram Mapping**
   ```javascript
   const pictogramMappings = {
     'flammable': 'ghs02',
     'corrosive': 'ghs05', 
     'toxic': 'ghs06',
     'environmental-hazard': 'ghs09',
     'explosive': 'ghs01',
     'oxidizing': 'ghs03'
   };
   ```

3. **Database Association**
   - Creates entries in `product_pictograms` table
   - Links products to applicable pictograms
   - Maintains relationship integrity

## Error Handling and Quality Control

### Data Quality Checks

1. **Validation Rules**
   - Required fields must be populated
   - Signal words must match hazard statements
   - Pictogram assignments must be appropriate
   - Data consistency between TDS and SDS

2. **Confidence Scoring**
   - High confidence: Clear, unambiguous data
   - Medium confidence: Some uncertainty
   - Low confidence: Ambiguous or conflicting data

3. **Manual Review Flags**
   - `needs_manual_review`: Complex or ambiguous cases
   - `has_ambiguities`: Conflicting information detected
   - `missing_critical_data`: Essential safety data missing

### Error Recovery

1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Continues processing with available data
   - Flags issues for manual review
   - Preserves original text when mapping unclear

2. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Processing statistics tracking
   - Performance monitoring
