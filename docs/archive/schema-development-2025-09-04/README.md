# Schema Development Archive - September 4, 2025

## Purpose
Historical schema development files from previous database analysis and type generation efforts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY
**DO NOT use these files for development.**

## üéØ Current/Authoritative Files
For active development, use:
- **docs/canonical-database-schema-2025-09-08.md** ‚Üê Primary reference
- **docs/canonical-schema-dump-2025-09-08.sql** ‚Üê Complete SQL schema
- **src/lib/database.types.ts** ‚Üê Current types (1,103 lines)

## Files in This Archive

### `database.types.ts.backup.20250908`
- **Purpose:** Backup of previous TypeScript database types
- **Size:** 541 lines (before comprehensive regeneration)
- **Date:** September 4, 2025 (last modified)
- **Status:** Superseded by fresh types with 1,103 lines

## Historical Context
These files represent the state of database type definitions before the canonical schema generation process. The backup types file shows the previous state (541 lines) compared to the comprehensive fresh generation (1,103 lines), demonstrating a 100% increase in type coverage.

The types in this archive were generated from an earlier state of the database and may not reflect the current complete schema structure, relationships, or enum definitions.

## What This Archive Achieved
- Provided working database types for development
- Enabled basic type safety for database operations
- Supported initial application development
- Served as baseline for schema comparison

## Why These Files Were Archived
- **Incomplete Coverage:** Previous types covered only partial schema
- **Outdated Structure:** Missing recent database changes and additions
- **Fresh Generation Available:** New authoritative types generated from live database
- **Single Source of Truth:** Eliminated confusion between multiple type definitions
