# Database Update Summary Report

## Overview
Successfully updated the products table with corrected CSV data focusing on columns that previously failed to upload due to incorrect headers.

## Update Results

### ‚úÖ Successfully Updated: 284 products total
- **First batch**: 266 products updated successfully
- **Second batch (fixes)**: 18 products with truncated shelf_life values

### üîß Issues Resolved
- **Shelf life truncation**: 18 products had shelf_life values longer than 255 characters, which were automatically truncated to fit the database constraint
- **Column mapping**: CSV headers now correctly map to database columns

### üìä Columns Updated
The following columns were successfully updated for all products:
- `description` - Product detailed descriptions
- `limitations` - Product usage limitations and warnings

5 products were not found in the database (likely due to slug differences):

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL

3. ‚úÖ Data integrity maintained with proper error handling

The database now contains the complete product information that was previously missing due to the CSV header issues.
