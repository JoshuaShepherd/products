COVERAGE RATE: Average rate is determined by surface porosity:

  New Concrete: 150-200 ft²/gal
  Light Broom finish: 200-400 ft²/gal
  Smoothed/Medium Trowel: 400-500 ft²/gal
  Dense/Polished Concrete: 800-1200 ft²/gal

A test area is recommended to determine actual coverage rates.

NEW CONCRETE: Surface should be dry, well cured (21 day minimum) using water, polyethylene, curing paper, SpecChem ""E Cure®"", or a dissipating resin based curing compound like ""SpecRez"".

Always test a small area to confirm appearance, compatibility, coverage and desired performance. Substrate must be free of oil, moisture, curing residue, dust, debris, and all other contaminants and must be absorptive to allow penetration of the ALL SHIELD EX. All joint sealants, caulks and patching should be in place before applying.


HORIZONTAL/VERTICAL SURFACES: Generously apply using a low pressure sprayer (airless sprayer 10 to 20 psi), roller, brush or broom. Broom or squeegee out any puddles or tire tracking marks.

Adjust application to wet only porous surfaces or apply additional coats in a wet-on-wet method. Do not allow excess or dry on the surface.

OLD CONCRETE AND MASONRY: Remove any previously applied sealers, dust, dirt, oil, etc. with power wash and SpecChem Orange Peel or Berry Peel. Let dry. Clean or use other appropriate measures to properly prepare the substrate. Membranes of any kind must be removed.

This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels.

The use of SpecChem ""Intrafilm"" as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.



Curing New Concrete:
Clean Lift 20/20 must be mixed or agitated before each use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied immediately after the final hard steel troweling at 250-350 sq ft per gal, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results.



Bond Breaker Coat:
Casting slab must be well cured, smooth and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply 300-400 sq ft per gal to the point of rejection. Wait until dry then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gal. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven due to light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bondbreaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet the affected areas with water to lift concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply Clean Lift 20/20. Hold squeegee to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is fully dry.



Bond Breaker Coat on Older/Weather Cured Concrete:
Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds. Remove all laitance that will affect bond breaker performance. Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied to the clean, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcements, spray apply at 300-400 sq ft per gal to the point of rejection. Wait until dry then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat.


Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply CLEAN LIFT 20/20 to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Do not apply additional coats dry. As levels of light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary. The application rate can vary greatly depending upon the roughness of the slab and the ambient conditions. It is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure the even presence of CLEAN LIFT 20/20 at the surface of the casting slab prior to pouring concrete.



Before Pouring Concrete:
Ensure that the entire treated surface has a dry soap/wax like feel to the touch. Test casting slab by sprinkling a few drops of water in several places. The water should not penetrate and may bead like on a newly waxed car. Fog the entire slab with water prior to pouring. When pouring concrete, avoid scouring the casting slab surface by using a deflection board. Heavy rains or rains prior to bond breaker coats drying may necessitate reapplication.



Stack Panels/Waste slabs:
Extra care must be used with stack panels and waste slabs as they tend to be more porous and can transfer water across their interface increasing the possibility of the “osmotic effect” thus leading to sticking. It is recommended that a SpecChem Cure & Seal or a double coat of bond breaker be applied as the cure coat prior to the bond breaker coat to lessen the chance of sticking.


Please contact SpecChem technical service for special instructions on Casting Slabs or Stack Panels and when using concrete mixes containing pozzolans (slag, fly ash).



Painting of Panels:
If Clean Lift 20/20 has been properly applied and has not been over applied, painting of the panels can be performed as soon as the moisture content in the concrete is at an acceptable level for the paint manufacturer. Coating manufacturer’s instructions for surface preparation must be followed and supersedes information in this data sheet.



Other instructions:
Do not apply in rain or if rain is forecast within 12 hours of application. Panels exposed to rain may require reapplication: 600-700 sq ft per gal. Not recommended for use as a thin breaker on smooth or rough formed surface. Apply for best results with a power sprayer or low pressure sprayer (Chapin, Hudson, etc) with a 1/2 gallon/min tip at a 40 psi pressure stream.

This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels.

The use of SpecChem ""Intrafilm"" as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.



Curing New Concrete:
Clean Lift 20/20 must be mixed or agitated before each use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied immediately after the final hard steel troweling at 250-350 sq ft per gal, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results.



Bond Breaker Coat:
Casting slab must be well cured, smooth and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply 300-400 sq ft per gal to the point of rejection. Wait until dry then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gal. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven due to light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bondbreaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet the affected areas with water to lift concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply Clean Lift 20/20. Hold squeegee to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is fully dry.



Bond Breaker Coat on Older/Weather Cured Concrete:
Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds. Remove all laitance that will affect bond breaker performance. Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied to the clean, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcements, spray apply at 300-400 sq ft per gal to the point of rejection. Wait until dry then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat.


Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply CLEAN LIFT 20/20 to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Do not apply additional coats dry. As levels of light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary. The application rate can vary greatly depending upon the roughness of the slab and the ambient conditions. It is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure the even presence of CLEAN LIFT 20/20 at the surface of the casting slab prior to pouring concrete.



Before Pouring Concrete:
Ensure that the entire treated surface has a dry soap/wax like feel to the touch. Test casting slab by sprinkling a few drops of water in several places. The water should not penetrate and may bead like on a newly waxed car. Fog the entire slab with water prior to pouring. When pouring concrete, avoid scouring the casting slab surface by using a deflection board. Heavy rains or rains prior to bond breaker coats drying may necessitate reapplication.



Stack Panels/Waste slabs:
Extra care must be used with stack panels and waste slabs as they tend to be more porous and can transfer water across their interface increasing the possibility of the “osmotic effect” thus leading to sticking. It is recommended that a SpecChem Cure & Seal or a double coat of bond breaker be applied as the cure coat prior to the bond breaker coat to lessen the chance of sticking.


Please contact SpecChem technical service for special instructions on Casting Slabs or Stack Panels and when using concrete mixes containing pozzolans (slag, fly ash).



Painting of Panels:
If Clean Lift 20/20 has been properly applied and has not been over applied, painting of the panels can be performed as soon as the moisture content in the concrete is at an acceptable level for the paint manufacturer. Coating manufacturer’s instructions for surface preparation must be followed and supersedes information in this data sheet.



Other instructions:
Do not apply in rain or if rain is forecast within 12 hours of application. Panels exposed to rain may require reapplication: 600-700 sq ft per gal. Not recommended for use as a thin breaker on smooth or rough formed surface. Apply for best results with a power sprayer or low pressure sprayer (Chapin, Hudson, etc) with a 1/2 gallon/min tip at a 40 psi pressure stream. Always ensure the complete presence of bond breaker prior to pouring panels.","CLEAN LIFT 20/20 is a chemically reactive water based tilt-up cure/bond breaker specifically engineered to provide a clean, easy lift of tilt-up panels and meet the moisture retention of ASTM C309.

Remove any sealer or other material that may prevent adhesion of CRYSTAL SHINE.   Application to Fresh Concrete - Crystal Shine dries quickly! Apply at a uniform coverage by spray at 250-350 sq ft/gal after all surface moisture has dissipated. Product may be sprayed with a hand held ""pump-up"" sprayer or in areas insufficiently based. Best result are achieved when spraying is used. If roller or applicator is used, work quickly using a short napped solvent resistant sleeve to avoid entrapping air (bubbles) and cob webbing.   When an extra high gloss is desired or on especially porous surfaces, two applications are recommended. Allow the first application to dry for 1-3 hours or until surface is dry to the touch.   Sealing Existing Concrete - The surface must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before applying CRYSTAL SHINE. Pressure washing with a strong alkaline detergent to remove dirt, waxes and oils is recommended. Acids will not sufficiently clean or remove dirt, curing compounds, or old sealer from concrete. Poor or porous areas may need a second application for uniform sealing and appearance. Allow 1-3 hours between application of sealer. In general, multiple thin coats (250 - 350 sq ft/gal) will provide a harder, more durable finish than a single heavy application. Dry time will be influenced by both temperature and humidity.","Crystal Shine HS SC Matte is a lacquer sealer developed for interior and exterior applications, to bring out the radiance and luster of exposed aggregate and other decorative concrete surfaces with a durable protective finish.

Remove any sealer or other material that may prevent adhesion of DECO SHINE MATTE. AGITATE WELL BEFORE EVERY USE!


Application to Fresh Concrete - Apply at uniform coverage by spray or roller at 350-400 sq ft/gal. Product may be sprayed with a hand held ""pump-up"" sprayer or an airless industrial sprayer. If roller applied, use a short napped solvent resistant sleeve.
When an extra high gloss is desired or on especially porous surfaces, another thin application can be applied the next day at 400-500 sq ft/gal.


Sealing Existing Concrete - The surface must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before applying Deco Shine Matte. Pressure washing with a strong alkaline detergent to remove dirt, waxes and oils is recommended. Acids will not sufficiently clean or remove dirt, curing compounds, or old sealer from concrete. More win porous areas may need a second application for uniform sealing and appearance. Allow 24 hours before 2nd application of sealer. In general, multiple thin coats (350-400 sq ft/gal) will provide a harder, more durable finish than a single heavy application. Dry time will be influenced by both temperature and humidity.","DECO SHINE MATTE is a methacrylate cure and sealer developed specifically for exterior applications, including exposed aggregate and other decorative concrete surfaces. DECO SHINE MATTE provides a clear protective coating that produces a subtle, satin/matte finish that highlights the color and texture of surfaces without excessive shine. DECO SHINE MATTE is ideal for stained concrete, exposed aggregate slabs, walkways, swimming pool decks and walls.","Dispose of contents/container in accordance with local/regional/national/international regulations. / Éliminer le contenu/récipient conformément à la réglementation locale/régionale/nationale/internationale.","","","IF ON SKIN (or hair): Take off immediately all contaminated clothing.

  Treated surfaces may be slippery when wet with rain or other liquids. (For added slip resistance use SpecChem Surface Grip.)
  For best results apply when concrete surfaces or ambient temperatures are between 55°F (12°C) and 80°F (26.7°C) Do not dilute.
  Use with adequate ventilation. Keep away from open flames.
  When sealing existing concrete, DECO SHINE MATTE may darken and highlight imperfections in hardened concrete surfaces, resulting in a mottled surface appearance. Prepare a test panel to ensure acceptable results.
  Do not apply in areas where there may be excessive internal water migration to the back of the film.

Use a clean, hand-pump or backpack sprayer with a low-pressure tip to distribute the product evenly. Lightly mist INTRAFILM over entire surface to be treated and intermix with any following screeding, floating, troweling, or other finishing procedures.


  INTRAFILM can also be applied through the water tanks on a ride-on trowel.
  Re-apply INTRAFILM to any localized areas where the concrete has begun to prematurely dry.
  Can be applied both before and after dry shake hardeners to allow surface moisture time to wet-out the dry-shake.


MIXING INSTRUCTIONS

INTRAFILM is available in a ready to use (RTU) formula and a concentrate to be diluted with water. Contents should be stirred or shaken vigorously prior to use to eliminate any settling that may occur upon storage or shipping.


The concentrate version can be diluted by mixing 1-part concentrate to 4-parts clean, potable water and stir or shake until mixture is uniform. Pour INTRAFILM directly into sprayer.","INTRAFILM is designed for use during the floating and troweling stages of concrete placement.

Recommended Tools: Epoxy mixing paddle, low speed drill, short-nap paint roller or notched squeegee, paint roller, squeegee, brush, or mechanical spray. All application equipment should be clean and free of contaminants prior to mixing or application. Avoid paintbrush.


MIXING

All materials should be conditioned in the temperature range of 65°F to 85°F. Mix parts together as follows:
1. Open Part B hardener container and pour into the epoxy resin container labeled Part A. Add 2 - Parts A to 1 - Part B by volume.
2. Mix together for 3 minutes. Once mixed, pour some of the epoxy back into the hardener container, mix for an additional minute, then pour all the material back into the resin container, ensuring that no hardener residue remains unattached. The epoxy must be well mixed to ensure proper chemical reaction. After mixing, place immediately on the prepared surface.","MVM PRIME 5000 is a 2-component, 100% solids epoxy moisture barrier system designed to effectively stop moisture vapor related problems on concrete prior to installing SpecChem underlayments or overlayment. MVM PRIME 5000 also provides an excellent bond to concrete and can be applied to concrete as early as 5 days old where early application of floor covering is required.

To remove the above, use a vacuum equipped, dry cut abrasive blade and oil-free compressed air to remove any debris and dust prior to applying RAPID FLEX 90.


Per ACI and PCA guidelines, Rapid Flex 90 should be installed full depth in sawcut control joints and a minimum of 2/3 joint depth in random cracks. No joint sealer or compressible backer rod is required. RAPID FLEX 90 should be applied to a minimum depth of 1/2 inch.


Mixing instructions: Temperature of RAPID FLEX 90 must be 50°F or above at the time of mixing. Stir/shake each component before dispensing. Use a 1:1 low pressure dual-component, proportioned metered pump with a 3/8” x 24” element static mixer.


Application: When using a cartridge or plural component pump, dispense mixed material into a waste container to assure a uniform color and a consistent 1:1 ratio. Then dispense properly mixed RAPID FLEX 90 into the prepared joint. Joints should be overfilled and allowed to cure for approximately 1 hour and up to 24 hours before shaving flush with a floor razor scraper. The cut joint must be flush with the floor to effectively transfer wheel loads.


Stain Protection: Since RAPID FLEX 90 sets so quickly, the potential for any overfill to stain the sides of the joint is unlikely. In applications where aesthetic and decorative or architectural finishes are critical, we recommend using Spec CJ Guard as a stain protectant and also to facilitate shaving.


If RAPID FLEX 90 is installed in a floor before maximum shrinkage has occurred, a crack may appear either adhesively or cohesively. This should not be considered a failure of the RAPID FLEX 90, which will continue to support the joint edge and transfer wheel loads. To remedy the situation, clean and out the crack, wipe clean with SpecChem Solvent 100 and refill with RAPID FLEX 90.","Joint preparation: Joints must be clean, dry and free of curing compound, densifiers, sealers and any other foreign substances. To remove the above, use a vacuum equipped, dry cut abrasive blade and oil-free compressed air to remove any debris and dust prior to applying RAPID FLEX 90.


Per ACI and PCA guidelines, Rapid Flex 90 should be installed full depth in sawcut control joints and a minimum of 2/3 joint depth in random cracks. No joint sealer or compressible backer rod is required. RAPID FLEX 90 should be applied to a minimum depth of 1/2 inch.


Mixing instructions: Temperature of RAPID FLEX 90 must be 50°F or above at the time of mixing. Stir/shake each component before dispensing. Use a 1:1 low pressure dual-component, proportioned metered pump with a 3/8” x 24” element static mixer.


Application: When using a cartridge or plural component pump, dispense mixed material into a waste container to assure a uniform color and a consistent 1:1 ratio. Then dispense properly mixed RAPID FLEX 90 into the prepared joint. Joints should be overfilled and allowed to cure for approximately 1 hour and up to 24 hours before shaving flush with a floor razor scraper. The cut joint must be flush with the floor to effectively transfer wheel loads.

New Concrete must be a minimum of 30 days old. All contaminants, oil, debris, coatings and unsound concrete must be removed.


Cracks should be prepared with a crack chaser, dry diamond blade, wet wheel on a hand grinder or a vacuum blast method. For surface patching applications hot and cold joints properly prepared with a crack chasing hammer, needle gun or diamond grinder. 4” large diameter bits conform to ICRI CSP 5-7 should be used. All spalls and patch areas require that heavy loose or unsound concrete be removed to a depth of at least 1/8”.


Cartridge Mixing: Poly Fix® should be conditioned to a temperature of 60°F to 80°F. Thoroughly shake the cartridge for 30 sec to mix each component. Remove the cap and holding upright, attach the flow restrictor to the cartridge then the static mixer with nut. Insert into dual cartridge and point the static mixer into a waste receptacle and dispense 4-5 inches of material to ensure proper mix. Once dispensing has started, do not turn upright to prevent backflow. Immediately apply the mixed product to the repair area.
Bulk Mixing: Poly Fix® is a very rapid-setting product. Therefore larger bulk mix units (2gal & 1gal) should be mixed in quart batches. Mix 1 pint Part A with 1 pint Part B for 30 sec then add up to 2 quarts of dry sand or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C, mix for an additional 15 sec and immediately place into the prepared repair area.
Placement: For cracks or patching repairs greater than 3/4"" wide. Pre-wet the area with Poly Fix® and fill with coarse dry sand (16/40) or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C to the proper elevation. Immediately saturate the sand with Poly Fix® resin, allowing to saturate the sand by means of the primed substrate. Apply additional sand if necessary while the resin fills and binds to the level of the surface. As Poly Fix® cures, the resin dries and hardens with full bearing. If necessary, sanding, grinding or polishing can begin 1-3 hours after initial cure.
Low Temperature Repairs: Condition Poly Fix® and any other materials (sand) to 70°F before mixing and applying in areas subject to cold. Cure time will be extended depending on the application area.","Surface Preparation: All concrete to be repaired must be clean, dry and sound. New Concrete must be a minimum of 30 days old.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.
Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet). As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the predampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
Mix 4.75 - 5.0 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill or mortar mixer. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by slowly adding the RepCon® 928 powder. For non-DOT applications, up to 5.25 pints can be used for greater flow. Mix 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period.
Placement: Trowel, or screed RepCon® 928 firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Finish RepCon® 928 level with the surrounding concrete and allow to take an initial set. After the initial set, when RepCon® 928 is surface hard, finish by hand trowelling. Excessive troweling is not required.
Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to best match the surrounding concrete. Do not add additional water to the surface during finishing. Lightly spray SpecFilm as a finishing aid on this and any other polymer modified mortars to assist in finishing. In all DOT applications or severe drying conditions (hot/dry or windy), curing should begin as soon as possible using wet burlap, a curing compound, or other approved method. Do not use solvent-based curing compounds.


DEEP APPLICATIONS

For DOT and heavy traffic applications (bridge deck, roadways, parking structures, etc) over 1”, RepCon® 928 should be extended with clean, SSD, 3/8” aggregate up to 60% by weight (30lbs).

New Concrete must be a minimum of 30 days old. All contaminants, oil, debris, coatings and unsound concrete must be removed. Cracks should be prepared with a crack chaser, dry diamond blade, wire wheel on a hand grinder or a wire brush. The crack must be thoroughly cleaned with a vacuum to remove all dust and debris. Larger joint repairs or patching applications must be properly prepared with a chipping hammer, needle gun or diamond grinder. A dry surface profile meeting ICRI CSP 3 is recommended. Large repairs subjected to heavy forklifts should have the perimeter recessed a min of 1/8”. Cartridge Mixing: Poly Fix® should be conditioned to a temperature of 60°F to 80°F. Thoroughly shake the cartridge for 30 sec to mix each component. Remove the cap and while holding upright, attach the flow restrictor to the cartridge then the static mixer with nut. Insert into dual cartridge gun and point the static mixer into a waste container and dispense 4-5 inches of material to assure proper mix. Once dispensing has started, do not turn upright to prevent backflow. Immediately apply the mixed material to the repair area. Bulk Mixing: Poly Fix® is a very rapid-setting product. Therefore larger bulk units (2gal & 10gal) should be mixed in quart batches. Mix 1 pint Part A with 1 pint Part B for 30 sec then add up to 2 quarts of dry sand or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C, mix for an additional 15 sec and immediately place into the prepared repair area. Placement: For cracks or patching repairs greater than 3/4” wide. Pre-wet the area with Poly Fix® and fill with coarse dry sand (16/40) or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C to the proper elevation. Immediately saturate the sand with Poly Fix®, making sure to saturate the sand down to the primed substrate. Apply additional sand if necessary and distribute and finish with a trowel to the desired texture. As the Poly Fix® cures and hardens it will turn gray. If necessary, sanding, grinding or polishing can begin 1-3 hours after final cure. Low Temperature Repairs: Condition Poly fix and any other materials (sand) to 70°F before mixing and applying to prepared substrate. Cure time will be extended depending on the application temperature.","Surface Preparation: All concrete to be repaired must be clean, dry and sound. New Concrete must be a minimum of 30 days old.

The crack must be thoroughly cleaned with a vacuum to remove all dust and debris. Larger joint repairs or patching applications must be properly prepared with a chipping hammer, needle gun or diamond grinder. A dry surface profile meeting ICRI CSP 3 is recommended. Large repairs subjected to heavy forklifts should have the perimeter recessed a min of 1/8”. Cartridge Mixing: Poly Fix® should be conditioned to a temperature of 60°F to 80°F. Thoroughly shake the cartridge for 30 sec to mix each component. Remove the cap and while holding upright, attach the flow restrictor to the cartridge then the static mixer with nut. Insert into dual cartridge gun and point the static mixer into a waste container and dispense 4-5 inches of material to assure proper mix. Once dispensing has started, do not turn upright to prevent backflow. Immediately apply the mixed material to the repair area. Bulk Mixing: Poly Fix® is a very rapid-setting product. Therefore larger bulk units (2gal & 10gal) should be mixed in quart batches. Mix 1 pint Part A with 1 pint Part B for 30 sec then add up to 2 quarts of dry sand or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C, mix for an additional 15 sec and immediately place into the prepared repair area. Placement: For cracks or patching repairs greater than 3/4” wide. Pre-wet the area with Poly Fix® and fill with coarse dry sand (16/40) or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C to the proper elevation. Immediately saturate the sand with Poly Fix®, making sure to saturate the sand down to the primed substrate. Apply additional sand if necessary and distribute and finish with a trowel to the desired texture. As the Poly Fix® cures and hardens it will turn gray. If necessary, sanding, grinding or polishing can begin 1-3 hours after final cure. Low Temperature Repairs: Condition Poly fix and any other materials (sand) to 70°F before mixing and applying to prepared substrate. Cure time will be extended depending on the application temperature.","Polyureas","","Poly Fix® is a high-strength, two-component ultra-low viscosity hybrid polyurethane concrete repair binder.

Do not cut in a “V” shape. Clean the substrate of all grease, wax, oil, contaminants, and curing compounds. Remove all weak, contaminated, or deteriorated concrete. Saturate the surface with water. SpecPlug will cure in the presence of running water.Mixing: Add a small amount of clean water to SpecPlug and mix to a putty consistency. Use an approximate ratio of 20% – 21% water to product (by weight). Mix only enough material that can be placed in 2 minutes: approximately 9.5 pints water to 50 lbs of product.Application: For vertical and moving-water applications, hold the product firmly in place until it reaches final set.

Abrade the surface to achieve a CSP profile of CSP 5-7 per ICRI Guideline #310.2-1997.Mixing Instructions: Ready to use, do not thin with any solvents. Air, material, and surface temperatures must be a minimum of 45°F (7°C) prior to mixing or installation. Premix each component separately, then mix 1 part of Part A with 1 part of Part B for 1 minute using a low-speed drill motor with a Jiffy mixer or paddle. Slowly add the pre-measured Part C component to the mixed liquid and continue mixing for 3 minutes until a smooth, lump-free consistency is achieved. Mix only as much material as can be used within the pot life.Bonding: Apply SpecPrep SB as a structural bonding agent for fresh concrete to hardened concrete. Neatly apply the SpecPrep SB into the SSD substrate with a stiff brush or by spraying with a hopper gun. SpecPrep SB should be applied at the rate of 65-75 sq. ft. per gallon to a minimum thickness of 20 mils. Repair mortar or concrete should be applied wet on wet or within the recommended open time. SpecPrep SB will act as an effective bonding agent for up to 24 hours at approximately 65°F.Steel Reinforcement Anti-Corrosion Coating: Apply 2 applications of SpecPrep SB by brush or sprayer at a thickness of 20 mils per coat to properly prepared steel reinforcement. Allow 2-4 hours between applications. Ensure to coat the underside of the rebar. Apply repair mortar or concrete after the second coat has dried and within 7 days.

Add one 5 gallon pail of TRIACT to a clean, empty 55 gallon drum. Add 50 gallons of a VOC compliant oil or other approved diluent. Agitate well. Spray apply at 1500 ft²/gallon to a properly prepared form surface prior to concrete placement.

Aluminum Form Seasoning Agent:
Add one 5 gallon pail of TRIACT to 10 gallons of a VOC compliant oil or release agent. Agitate well. Apply to new, unseasoned aluminum forms at a rate of 500 ft²/gallon. All form surfaces (front, back & sides) should be treated. Allow the treated forms to sit overnight. Reapply TRIACT mixture as a release agent at 1000–1500 sq-ft per gallon prior to concrete placement. Continue to use TRIACT mixture as a release agent for 4-5 additional concrete pours before converting back to Spec Strip Plus or another quality reactive form release.

Concrete Softener/Remover:
Remove as much of the loose concrete build up as possible using a high pressure power washer. The surfaces to be coated should be reasonably dry prior to treatment. Apply undiluted TRIACT generously (100-500 ft²/gallon) to areas with existing heavy buildup. Allow build-up to soften for 6-8 hours and remove with a scraper or a power washer. Heavy buildup will generally require multiple coats to fully soften buildup. Difficult to remove build up may require the use of SPECBLAST.

Maintenance Coating:
Every 3-4 weeks, or when your aluminum forms start to develop a concrete build up or a concrete scum, apply a mixture of one 5 gallon pail of TRIACT to a drum of SpecChem Form Release Agent. Agitate well before use and apply the TRIACT/form release mixture as your form release @ a rate of 1000-1500 sq-ft per gallon. The TRIACT will act as a self cleaning additive to your daily forming operation without removing your forms from use. Repeat until build-up and scum are removed.

Protective Barrier:
Use undiluted TRIACT to prevent concrete adhesion and build-up by applying to clean concrete placement equipment such as laser screeds, power trowels, concrete buckets, concrete paving machines, chutes, shovels, screeds, etc. Equipment in concrete block plants can be kept free of build-up by spraying a light coat on mixers, hoppers and chutes. Lightly spray TRIACT over the interior of concrete mixers after clean out to prevent concrete bonding.

Climate (temperature) and mix design are key variables that need to be considered for a successful project.
Mix VERSA ETCH thoroughly before each use. Prior to use, protect surrounding surfaces, concrete walks, curbs, etc from overspray and wash down residue.
Place concrete and float, screed or trowel level. For added texture, spread extra aggregate on the surface and trowel or float into the surface, ensuring that each rock is completely surrounded by cement paste.
As soon as surface water has disappeared, use a plastic sprayer and evenly spray a thorough coat of VERSA ETCH over the entire area to be treated. Normal application rate is approximately 200-300 square feet per gallon. Do not apply too sparingly. Versa Etch will dry in 1-2 hours depending on ambient conditions.
Once the VERSA ETCH feels dry to the touch, apply VERSA ETCH EXTENDER over the top of VERSA ETCH. This will help create a more uniform etch and extend the removal time of the VERSA ETCH, especially in hot weather. Coverage for Versa Etch Extender is approximately 400 sq ft per gal.
Anywhere from 6 hours to 24 hours later, flush off the retarded and extender from the concrete with a garden hose and stiff broom, a pressure washer, or a garden hose and floor scrubber with stiff bristle pad. Ensure that the pressure washer force is not excessive. Rinse equipment with water immediately after use.
Follow up with one of SpecChem’s penetrating or decorative sealers to protect concrete at the end.
A small mock-up, adjacent to the project, applied and finished with the same mix design, conditions and techniques can be very helpful in determining the proper timing and procedures for a successful application.","As jobsite conditions and mix designs (min. 3500 psi) vary, a test panel should always be performed to determine the proper grade of retarder to achieve the desired depth of etch.

Curing, sealing, hardening and dustproofing:

  Hard Troweled Finish: 300-500 sq ft / gal
  Broom or Float Finish: 200-400 sq ft / gal
  Rough Finish: 200-300 sq ft / gal
  Aged Concrete: 200-300 sq ft / gal
  Vertical Surface: 200-300 sq ft / gal

The above rates are approximate. Exact coverage depends upon the porosity of the concrete and finishing requirements. For optimum hardening of porous surfaces, apply two coats.


Apply immediately after final finishing operations and after the bleed water has receded. Brush out puddles and runs. Over application and puddling will leave white crystals, which must be removed by immediately flushing the surface with water and scrubbing.


May be applied with sprayer, brush or roller. Spraying provides superior results.


Application temperatures 40°F to 100°F.


Protect metal, glass, painted and brick surfaces from CONCRETE CURE. If accidentally misapplied, wash with clean water at once.


For aged concrete, surface must be free of dirt and all other foreign matter. Surface should be dry to permit maximum penetration.


As jobsite conditions vary, a test panel should always be performed.","CONCRETE CURE is a spray applied concrete cure, hardener and dustproofer. CONCRETE CURE deeply penetrates concrete surfaces to densify, seal, harden and dustproof concrete and Portland Cement based material surfaces to help them achieve maximum abrasion resistance and without altering the natural appearance of the concrete.

Application to Fresh Concrete: Apply at a uniform coverage by spray at 250-350 sq ft/gal. Product may be sprayed with a hand held ""pump-up"" sprayer or an airless industrial sprayer. Best result are achieved when spray applied. If roller applied, use a short napped solvent resistant sleeve and avoid entrapping air (bubbles).


When an extra high gloss is desired or on especially porous surfaces, apply an additional coat @ 400 sq-ft/gal. Allow the first application to dry for 1-3 hours until surface is dry to the touch.



Sealing Existing Concrete: The surface must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before applying CRYSTAL SHINE. Pressure wash or use a strong alkaline detergent to remove dirt, waxes and oils is recommended. Acid will not sufficiently remove dirt, curing compounds, or old sealer from concrete. Worn or porous areas may need a second application for uniform sealing and appearance. Allow 12 hours before foot and pedestrian traffic.

CRYSTAL SHINE is ideal for stained concrete, exposed aggregate slabs, walkways, swimming pool decks and walls. CRYSTAL SHINE protects the concrete surface from dirt, staining, de-icing salts and other liquid contaminants.

CRYSTAL SHINE is formulated with a unique solvent blend allowing fast-drying, solvent-base performance along with VOC compliance in the OTC/LADCO/MRPO and SCAQMD regions.","Dispose of contents/container in accordance with local/regional/national/international regulations.","","","IF ON SKIN (or hair): Take off immediately all contaminated clothing.

Remove any sealer or other material that may prevent adhesion of CRYSTAL SHINE.   Application to Fresh Concrete - Crystal Shine dries quickly! Apply at a uniform coverage by spray at 250-350 sq ft /gal after all surface moisture has dissipated. Product may be applied with a hand held ""pump-up"" sprayer or an airless industrial sprayer. Best result are achieved when spray held perpendicular to surface at 12-18 inches above slab. Avoid excessive build up, runs or puddles. Over application may result in air entrapment (bubbles) and cold check lines.   When an extra high gloss is desired or on exceptionally porous surfaces, two applications may be required. Allow the first application to dry for 1-3 hours or until surface is dry to the touch.   Sealing Existing Concrete - the surface must be clean. Allow the first application to dry before applying CRYSTAL SHINE. Pressure washing or washing with a strong detergent followed by rinsing and drying is recommended. Use of waxes and oils is recommended. Acids will not sufficiently clean or remove dirt, curing compounds, or old sealer from concrete. Worn or porous areas may need additional coats for uniform sealing and appearance. Allow 1-3 hours before 2nd application of sealer. In general, multiple thin coats (250 - 350 sq ft/gal) will provide a harder, more durable finish than a single heavy coat. Dry time will be influenced by both temperature and humidity.","Surface Preparation - The concrete surface must be clean and free of standing water.

Remove any sealer or other material that may prevent adhesion of CRYSTAL SHINE SC. Application to Fresh Concrete - Crystal Shine dries quickly! Apply at a uniform coverage by spray at 250-350 sq ft/gal after all surface moisture has dissipated. Product may be sprayed with a hand held ""pump-up"" sprayer or an airless industrial sprayer. Best results are achieved when spray applied. If a roller or applicator is used, work quickly using a short napped solvent resistant sleeve to avoid entrapping air (bubbles) and cob webbing. When an extra high gloss is desired or on especially porous surfaces, two applications are recommended. Allow the first application to dry for 1-3 hours or until surface is dry to the touch. Sealing Existing Concrete - The surface must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before applying Crystal Shine SC. Pressure washing with a strong alkaline detergent to remove dirt, waxes and oils is recommended. Acids will not sufficiently clean or remove dirt, curing compounds, or old sealer from concrete. Worn or porous areas may need a second application for uniform sealing and appearance. Allow 1-3 hours before 2nd application of sealer. In general, multiple thin coats (250 - 350 sq ft/gal) will provide a harder, more durable finish than a single heavy application. Dry time will be influenced by both temperature and humidity.","CRYSTAL SHINE SC is a lacquer sealer developed for interior and exterior applications, to bring out the radiance and luster of exposed aggregate and other decorative concrete surfaces with a durable protective finish. CRYSTAL SHINE SC is ideal for stained concrete, exposed aggregate slabs, walkways, swimming pool decks and walls. CRYSTAL SHINE SC is formulated with a unique solvent blend allowing fast-drying, solvent-base performance along with VOC compliance in the OTC/LADCO/MRPO regions.

Cure & Seal 25 EX should not be applied on hot surfaces or in direct sunlight as this could cause rapid evaporation and will not allow the film to form properly. Under these conditions the film may bubble, peel and/or blush. Tip: If spraying Cure & Seal 25 EX keep pressure in pump up sprayers as high as possible to ensure a steady and even spray pattern. Maintain the sprayer tip near the concrete, within 12 inches.


Curing/Sealing/Dustproofing: 300 – 400 sq ft / gal


For dustproofing and sealing benefits to freshly placed concrete, apply two coats at 500 sq ft / gal. On broom or rough finished concrete, double the coverage rate. Coverage may vary due to porosity and conditions of the concrete.


New Concrete: CURE & SEAL 25 EX should be applied as soon as the surface water has disappeared and the concrete surface will not be marred by the walking applicator. At this point, apply in a uniform coat. For a superior finish and added curing and sealing protection, apply a second coat at 400 sq ft / gal.

  Curing Fresh Concrete: 200 – 250 sq ft / gal
  Existing Concrete: 200 – 300 sq ft / gal


On broom or rough finished concrete, increase the coverage rate to compensate for the added surface area. Coverage may vary due to porosity and conditions of the concrete.


New Concrete: CURE SHIELD should be applied as soon as the surface water has disappeared and the concrete surface will not be marred by the walking applicator. At this point, apply in a uniform coat leaving no gaps. Do not allow the material to puddle.


Existing Concrete: Concrete surface must be clean, dry or damp and free of all stains, oil, grease, dirt, and other contaminants that can prevent adhesion or penetration of the Cure Shield.
An application of CURE SHIELD will renovate existing concrete surfaces. These surfaces will be brighter and easier to clean and maintain.","CURE SHIELD is a solvent-based blend of silane and pure acrylic copolymers designed to cure and seal fresh concrete and provide additional protection to existing concrete.


CURE SHIELD provides a non-yellowing, clear film which effectively cures and protects fresh concrete.
In addition to forming an effective film-forming curing and sealing compound, it also contains silane. Silane penetrates the fresh concrete and provides protection against spalling and deterioration of concrete structures caused by de-icing salts.
CURE SHIELD can be applied to fresh concrete unlike other siloxane, silane type products and also meets ASTM C309 and 1315 curing standards.
CURE SHIELD penetrates the surface and bonds directly with the substrate, which results in a surface that is highly resistant to moisture and salt.","Dispose of contents/container in accordance with local/regional/national/international regulations.","","","IF ON SKIN (or hair): Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with water/shower. In case of fire: Use dry sand, dry chemical or alcohol-resistant foam for extinction. IF ON SKIN: Wash with plenty of water.

The concrete surface must be clean, dry, and free of all stains, oil, grease, dust, and other contaminants that may prevent adhesion of DECO SHINE BROWN EX.

Sealing Existing Concrete
On suitable surfaces, the surface must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before application. Remove all existing coatings, waxes, curing compounds, or old sealer from concrete. Form oil or pavers may need a second application for uniform sealing and appearance. Allow 24 hours before subjecting to foot traffic. Multiple coats may be required for maximum durability and appearance. Apply in a single heavy application. Dry time will be influenced by weather conditions.

Application to Fresh Concrete
Deco Shine Brown EX should be applied only after the surface is dry. Apply at coverage rates of 250-350 sq ft/gal depending on surface porosity and finish. Apply with a short nap roller or airless sprayer. Avoid puddling or excessive build up. Allow 24 hours to dry for foot traffic. Do not use on surfaces that are subject to standing water. Allow full cure for 3-7 days before use.","DECO SHINE BROWN EX is a brown pigmented lacquer sealer developed for interior and exterior applications. It is designed for use on aged or old hard, broom finished concrete surfaces. DECO SHINE BROWN EX, combined with a brown tinted protective coating that bridges surface and hairline cracks, is ideal for natural aggregate, porous pavements and aging, durable finish.

Broom or Float Finish: 300-400 sq ft/gal
Rough Finish: 200-300 sq ft/gal
Vertical Surface: 400-500 sq ft/gal


The above rates are approximate. Exact coverage depends upon the porosity of the concrete as well as the job requirements.
Extend application rate to 1000 sq-ft per gal with the use of a micro-fiber applicator on extremely hard trowelled, burnished concrete floors (ie Wal-Mart, Kohl’s Projects)


Apply immediately after final finishing operations and after the bleed water had receded. The use of a micro-fiber applicator will aid when applying at 800-1000 sq-ft per gal.
Over application and puddling may leave white crystals, which must be removed immediately by flushing the surface with water, scrubbing and squeegee clean.
Properly applied, cure membrane will dissipate in 3 to 5 days without subsequent coatings or treatments to produce.
May be applied with sprayer, brush or roller. Spraying provides superior results. Application temperatures 40°F to 90°F.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineer-approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface. Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB, and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time. As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries. Mixing: Mix 7.0–7.5 pints of Duo Patch Admix per 50-pound bag of material. Mix with a low-speed drill. Add the recommended amount of Duo Patch Admix into the container, followed by slowly adding the Duo Patch powder. Mix for 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period. Duo Patch can be applied in applications from 1/8” to 2” in a lift. Deep Applications: For repair applications over 1”, Duo Patch should be extended with clean, SSD, 3/8” aggregate up to 60% by weight (30 lbs) and mixed for an additional 2 minutes. This extension will add approximately 0.15 cu-ft to the unit yield and should be placed within 15-20 minutes. Placement: Trowel, screed, or pour Duo Patch firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Finish Duo Patch level with the surrounding concrete and allow it to take an initial set. After the initial set, when Duo Patch is surface hard, finish by hand troweling. Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to best match the surrounding concrete. Do not add additional water to the surface during finishing. Lightly spray SpecFilm as a finishing aid to assist in finishing. Duo Patch is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C309-compliant, water-based SpecChem curing compound.

Deep Applications: For repair applications over 1”, Duo Patch should be extended with clean, SSD, 3/8” aggregate up to 60% by weight (30 lbs) and mixed for an additional 2 minutes. This extension will add approximately 0.15 cu-ft to the unit yield and should be placed within 15-20 minutes. Placement: Trowel, screed, or pour Duo Patch firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Finish Duo Patch level with the surrounding concrete and allow it to take an initial set. After the initial set, when Duo Patch is surface hard, finish by hand troweling. Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to best match the surrounding concrete. Do not add additional water to the surface during finishing. Lightly spray SpecFilm as a finishing aid to assist in finishing. Duo Patch is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C309-compliant, water-based SpecChem curing compound. Clean tools with water immediately after use.","Repair Mortars","Repair Mortars","Duo Patch is a two-component, polymer-modified concrete repair mortar for use in a variety of horizontal repair and form-and-pour applications.

","Surface Preparation: The concrete must be sound and free of all foreign material, including oil, grease, dust, laitance, or other surface contaminants. For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineer-approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface. Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB, and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time. As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries. Mixing: Mix 7.0–7.5 pints of Duo Patch Admix per 50-pound bag of material. Mix with a low-speed drill. Add the recommended amount of Duo Patch Admix into the container, followed by slowly adding the Duo Patch powder. Mix for 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period.

Repeat until build-up and scum are removed. Aluminum forms that have developed a heavy scum coat or concrete build-up should receive a moderately heavy coat of EZ Clean & Release 24 hours before pouring. Repeat process on subsequent pours until build-up and scum are removed. Once build up is removed, resume using SpecStrip or another SpecChem reactive form release agent. Heavy Hardened Concrete: Apply EZ CLEAN & RELEASE or TRI ACT generously (100-500 ft²/gallon) to areas with existing heavy build-up. Allow build-up to soften for 6-8 hours and remove with a scraper or a power washer. Heavy build-up will generally require multiple coats to fully soften build-up. Difficult to remove build up may require the use of SPECBLAST.

Aluminum forms that have developed a heavy scum coat or concrete build-up should receive a moderately heavy coat of EZ Clean & Release Cherry 24 hours before pouring. Repeat process on subsequent pours until build-up and scum are removed. Once build up is removed, resume using SpecStrip or another SpecChem reactive form release agent. Heavy Hardened Concrete: Apply EZ CLEAN & RELEASE CHERRY or TRI ACT generously (100-500 ft²/gallon) to areas with existing heavy build-up. Allow build-up to soften for 6-8 hours and remove with a scraper or a power washer. Heavy build-up will generally require multiple coats to fully soften build-up. Difficult to remove build up may require the use of SPEC-BLAST. Protective Barrier: Use EZ CLEAN & RELEASE CHERRY to prevent concrete adhesion and build-up by applying to clean equipment such as chutes, shovels, screeds etc. Equipment in concrete block plants can be kept free of build-up by spraying a light coat on mixers, hoppers and chutes. Lightly spray EZ CLEAN & RELEASE CHERRY over the interior of concrete mixers after clean out to prevent concrete bonding. Concrete splatter will harden, but will not bond to coated surfaces and can be power washed.","Form Release Agents & Form Treatment","","EZ CLEAN & RELEASE CHERRY is a ready to use highly reactive petroleum mixture that, when properly applied to concrete forms with concrete build-up, will soften the hardened concrete and “self-clean” as the forms are stripped.

Spray product on side rails while forms are still in stacks. Lay forms on the ground, face up. Apply Form Seasoning WB to the point of rejection, typically 300 sq ft/gal. Uniform bubbling on the form surface indicates that the product is properly reacting with the aluminum. Average reaction time is 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the form temperature. Do not allow Form Seasoning WB to dry on the form; lightly mist with water or more Form Seasoning WB if necessary.Remove the product with a hose or low-pressure (100 psi or lower) sprayer. Do not use a high-pressure washer as the newly formed oxides on the form surface can be disturbed. Once dry, the oxides will be bonded to the surface. Forms will be dull and almost gray in color. If shiny areas are still present, a second application will be necessary. Allow forms to dry. Once dry, use a quality reactive release agent to achieve a clean release. Apply at 300 sq ft/gal to ensure proper seasoning of forms.","Form Seasoning WB is a water-based treatment for new aluminum forms. It oxidizes the elemental aluminum on the surface of new aluminum forms to properly season and prepare them for use. Once seasoned, use a quality reactive form release agent to produce a clean release. Properly seasoned aluminum forms are required to reduce sticking that can take place between aluminum and fresh concrete.

Remove form marks and other protrusions to prevent “show through”. Surface must have an open capillary system to provide grip for the IntraCon. If concrete has a smooth finish sandblasting is recommended to lightly roughen the concrete surface. Repair all surface defects with IntraCon Mortar. Moisten the application area and allow to dry for 10 minutes. IntraCon requires a water-saturated surface during application. Wet concrete surface thoroughly with potable water, and remove excess water (ponding) before IntraCon is applied. It is essential that the concrete surface does not dry before IntraCon is applied if concrete surface does dry rewet the area.
Mixing: Mix IntraCon with potable water to reach a thin cake batter consistency. Recommended ratios for brush application is 5 parts powder to 2 parts water. For spray application use 5 parts powder to 3 parts water. IntraCon needs to be applied within 20 minutes after mixing.

(Admixing: When IntraCon is used as additive, IntraCon must be added to the concrete in the final batching. Dosage Rate: 1.7-2.0% by weight of cement.)

For patching or repair applications use 15% of water/50 lbs bag of IntraCon.

Placement: If IntraCon is being applied by a hand brush or broom then just two mix ratios are used. Apply in a thin uniform thick coating no thicker than 1/16th of an inch. If the project requires a second application wait until the first coat has set before applying the second. A second coat should not be applied after a time period of 2 days. IntraCon should not be applied in rainy or cold conditions (below 40°F).

Application: A fine tip sprayer should be used to lightly wet the surface of the IntraCon once it has set. Typically the surface should be wet with water multiple times a day. In cases of high temperatures, winds and low humidity more applications will be necessary. IntraCon must be protected from direct sun and excessive high temperatures as drying time affects H2O hours. No covering should be in contact with the surface of the IntraCon during this time as well. If the structure is used to retain a liquid a curing length of 3 days is required and two weeks should pass before the structure is required to hold liquid.","Surface Preparation: The surface must be structurally sound, clean and free of dirt, release agent, efflorescence, curing compounds, laitance, and other contaminants.

The concrete surface must be prepared using mechanical methods shotblasts to a minimum ICRI Concrete Surface Profile of 3 (CSP #3). Acid etching is not acceptable. SpecChem cannot be responsible for variations in slab design, preparation, isolation or moving joints resulting from dry up, delowage, shrink or cracking after installation of vapor barrier system.


Recommended Tools: Epoxy mixing paddle, low speed drill, paint roller, squeegee, brush, or mechanical spray. All application equipment should be clean and free of contaminants prior to mixing or application.


MIXING

All materials should be acclimated to the application temperature range of 65°F to 85°F. Mix parts together as follows:
1. Open Part B hardener container and pour into the epoxy resin container labeled Part A. Add 1 - Part B to 2 - Parts A by volume.
2. Mix together for 3 minutes. Once mixed, pour some of the epoxy back into the hardener container, mix for an additional minute, then pour all the material back into the resin container, ensuring the hardener and resin are fully blended.
3. Continue mixing until no streaks remain and product is uniform. Use immediately after mixing. The epoxy must be mixed to ensure proper chemical reaction. After mixing, place immediately on the prepared surface.","MVM PRIME 5000 is a 2-component, 100% solids epoxy moisture barrier system designed to effectively stop moisture vapor related problems on concrete prior to installing SpecChem underlayments or overlayment.

All surfaces to be repaired should be high pressure water blasted to produce an open rough surface profile (min CSP 3-4). Surface must be misted/dampened with water in a saturated-surface-dry (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface. When applying in a thin overlay by broom or squeegee, be sure to scrub a bond coat into the pre-dampened surface prior to overlay to ensure proper adhesion.


Mixing: Mix by hand or with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of water into the container, followed by slowly adding the OVERCRETE powder. Suggested mix water for OVERCRETE is approximately 2.5 to 5.75 pints per 40 LB bag (13.7%-15.0% by weight) depending on desired consistency. Mix 2-3 minutes. All product should be applied within the 25 minute working time. Do not mix longer than 3 minutes. Do not over water, over mix or re-temper.


Placement: When placing with a trowel, broom or squeegee, it may be necessary to use a squeegee to force OVERCRETE into cracks, voids and honeycombed areas. OVERCRETE should be smoothed or troweled and spread easily. For deep applications, apply in lifts allowing each layer to dry before applying the next. Additional thin OVERCRETE applications can be applied as the final overlay. Extreme weather applications should only be done to further application when all guidelines have been observed, especially heat and wind. OVERCRETE may be spray applied with a hopper gun.

All surfaces to be repaired should be high pressure water blasted to produce an open rough surface profile (min CSP 3-4). Surface must be misted/dampened with water in a saturated-surface-dry (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface. When applying in a thin overlay by broom or squeegee, be sure to scrub a bond coat into the pre-dampened surface prior to overlay to ensure proper adhesion.


Mixing: Mix by hand or with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of water into the container, followed by slowly adding the OVERCRETE powder. Suggested mix water for OVERCRETE is approximately 2.5 to 5.75 pints per 40 LB bag (13.7%-15.0% by weight) depending on desired consistency. Mix 2-3 minutes. All product should be applied within the 25 minute working time. Do not mix longer than 3 minutes. Do not over water, over mix or re-temper.


Placement: When placing with a trowel, broom or squeegee, it may be necessary to use a squeegee to force OVERCRETE into cracks, voids and honeycombed areas. OVERCRETE should be smoothed or troweled and spread easily. For deep applications, apply in lifts allowing each layer to dry before applying the next. Additional thin OVERCRETE applications can be applied as the final overlay. Extreme weather applications should only be done to further application when all guidelines have been observed, especially heat and wind. OVERCRETE may be spray applied with a hopper gun.

CURING

OVERCRETE will reach its final cure in twenty-four hours. Protect from rain or excess water until cured.","OVERCRETE is a one-component, polymer-modified concrete repair/resurfacing mortar for smoothing, resurfacing, and restoring concrete surfaces. OVERCRETE offers superior durability for all interior and exterior concrete applications. OVERCRETE is available in 2 formulations:
OverCrete-Fine is blended with fine sands for a smoother finish on repairs from a feather to 1/2"".
OverCrete-Coarse is blended with fine/coarse sands for a broom finish on repairs from 1/8"" to 1.5"".","Dispose of contents/container in accordance with local/regional/national/international regulations.","","","If inhaled, move to fresh air.

Do not add latex or other additives to this product. Mixing equipment should be cleaned with water immediately after use. Joints and cracks in the existing concrete will telegraph through the OVERCRETE overlay.
The application of a sealer like SpecChem SureSpred will improve abrasion resistance of the repair in exposed horizontal applications.
Do not allow repairs to freeze until the material has reached a minimum of 1000 psi compressive strength.
In adornments or freeze, follow ACI recommendations. Do not mix when air or substrate temperature is below 50°F. 50°F is required at the time of application. For subfreezing applications, condition material to between 65°F and 85°F.

Substrate must be structurally sound and free of all foreign, grease, oil, dirt or any other contaminants that may adversely affect the bond. Prepared surfaces must be dust-free and must have sufficient profile to ensure adequate mechanical lock.  Mixing and Application Guidelines: Agitate well before use.  Bonding Agent: Apply a uniform coating of undiluted PLASTER BOND at 250 sq.ft per gallon to the prepared substrate by brush, roller or sprayer. If spray applied, brush or broom into the substrate to ensure an even film over the entire area to be bonded. The open time will be when the product dries to the touch. Dry time is 20-30 min at 70°F. PLASTER BOND will remain slightly tacky when dry. Accumulation in low areas should be wiped or evenly distributed for uniform dry time. This will help prevent over-application to speed drying time. Under normal conditions, PLASTER BOND can be applied up to 24 hours before installation of plaster/adhesional toppings. All materials should be kept to a minimum.  Rewettable Applications: For rewettable applications of PLASTER BOND: Always re-tackify the bonding agent with a water mist if a continuous film is not achieved on the surface, reapply PLASTER BOND.  Place plaster or stucco within 24 hours of application.  The application instructions highlight typical conditions. (When in doubt, always apply a test patch.)   Application Rate: 250 sq.ft per gal depending on the roughness/porosity of the substrate.","Surface Preparation: Mechanically abrade existing substrate to remove all unsound concrete.

The hole must be free of particles and debris. Water-scrub sides and bottom with stiff scrub brush. Remove excess water. The hole must be clean and uniformly damp. Always use the appropriate flat washer for the size bolt you are anchoring. Place bolt in hole with head down and washer resting on the head.


Mixing and Interior Applications: Add a 1/2 quart (16 oz.) of clean potable water to every 5 pounds of POR-ROK® and mix to a smooth, flowable consistency. If mixing smaller amounts by hand mix 3.2 oz. water for every 1 pound of POR-ROK®. Once the mix is lump free, pour the material around the bolt or anchor. Fill the material slightly above substrate level. DO NOT LEAVE THE POR-ROK® SET WHERE WATER CAN PUDDLE AROUND THE BOLT OR ANCHOR. For applications that require a more plastic-like consistency, reduce the amount of water slightly until the desired consistency is achieved.


Exterior Applications: When using Por-Rok® Products for exterior applications where excessive standing water is present, CGM recommends the use of Super Por-Rok®. In cases where aluminum railings are being installed, CGM HIGHLY recommends the use of Super Por-Rok® for all environmental conditions; however one of the two following options MUST be used in standing water environments to achieve optimum bond strength and performance. 
OPTION 1: Once the POR-ROK® is set (15 min.), mix and additional amount of POR-ROK® with slightly less water and cone the material above the anchor. Prevent water from settling on the surface and possibly damaging the installation. 
OPTION 2: Fill the hole with POR-ROK® flush to the top of the concrete. 7 days after installation seal with any sealer rated for exterior use. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MITIGATE STANDING WATER FROM POR-ROK® WILL RESULT IN POSSIBLE PRODUCT FAILURE.

To remove the above, use a vacuum equipped, dry cut abrasive blade and oil-free compressed air to remove any debris and dust prior to applying RAPID FLEX CJ.


Per ACI and PCA guidelines, Rapid Flex CJ should be installed full depth in sawcut control joints and a minimum of 2/3 joint depth in random cracks. No joint sealer or compressible backer rod is required. RAPID FLEX CJ should be applied to a minimum depth of 1/2 inch.


Mixing instructions: Temperature of RAPID FLEX CJ must be 50°F or above at the time of mixing. Stir/shake each component before dispensing. Use a 1:1 low pressure dual-component, proportioned metered pump with a 3/8” x 24” element static mixer.


Application: When using a cartridge or plural component pump, dispense mixed material into a waste container to assure a uniform color and a consistent 1:1 ratio. Then dispense properly mixed RAPID FLEX CJ into the prepared joint. Joints should be overfilled and allowed to cure for approximately 1 hour and up to 24 hours before shaving flush with a floor razor scraper. The cut joint must be flush with the floor to effectively transfer wheel loads.


Stain Protection: Since RAPID FLEX CJ sets so quickly, the potential for any overfill to stain the sides of the joint is unlikely. In applications where aesthetic and decorative or architectural finishes are critical, we recommend using Spec CJ Guard as a stain protectant and also to facilitate shaving.


If RAPID FLEX CJ is installed in a floor before maximum shrinkage has occurred, a crack may appear either adhesively or cohesively. This should not be considered a failure of the RAPID FLEX CJ, which will continue to support the joint edge and transfer wheel loads. To remedy the situation, clean and out the crack, wipe clean with SpecChem Solvent 100 and refill with RAPID FLEX CJ.","Joint preparation: Joints must be clean, dry and free of curing compound, densifiers, sealers and any other foreign substances.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.
Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet).
As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
Mixing: Add 4.5 - 5.0 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by slowly adding the RepCon® H powder. Mix 3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period. RepCon® H can be applied in applications from ¼” to 2” in a lift.
Deep Applications: For repair applications over 2”, RepCon® H should be extended with clean, SSD, 3/8” aggregate up to 80% by weight (30 lbs) and mix an additional 2 minutes. This extension will add approx 0.17 cu-ft to the unit yield and should be placed within 20-30 minutes. Extended mixes will depend on the gradation of the aggregate but normally will reduce compressive strength by 500 psi.
Placement: Trowel, or screed RepCon® H firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Finish RepCon® H level with the surrounding concrete and allow to take an initial set. After the initial set, when RepCon® H is surface hard, finish by hand troweling.
Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to best match the surrounding concrete. Do not add additional water to the surface during finishing. Lightly spray SpecFilm as a finishing aid on this and any other polymer modified mortars to assist in finishing. RepCon® H is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C309 compliant, water based SpecChem curing compound.","Surface Preparation: The concrete must be sound and free of all foreign material, including oil, grease, dust, laitance or other surface contaminants.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.
Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet).
As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
Mixing: Mix 4.5 – 5.0 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by slowly adding the RepCon® H-350 powder. Mix 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period. RepCon® H-350 can be applied in applications from ¼” to 2” in a lift.
Deep Applications: For repair applications over 2”, RepCon® H-350 should be extended with clean, SSD, 3/8” aggregate up to 80% by weight (25lbs) and mix an additional 2 minutes. This extension will add approx 0.15 cu-ft to the unit yield and should be placed within 10-15 minutes.
Placement: Trowel, or screed RepCon® H-350 firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Finish RepCon® H-350 level with the surrounding concrete and allow to take an initial set. After the initial set, when RepCon® H-350 is surface hard, finish by hand troweling.
Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to best match the surrounding concrete. Do not add additional water to the surface during finishing. Lightly spray SpecFilm as a finishing aid on this and any other polymer modified mortars to assist in finishing. RepCon® H-350 is self-curing under most conditions.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered-approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB, and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet).Mixing: Mix 6.25–6.75 pints of clean water per 50-pound bag of material. Mix with a low-speed drill. Add the recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by slowly adding the RepCon VO. Mix for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period.Placement: Trowel RepCon VO firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Use slightly more material than is needed and roughly shape during placement. After the initial set, when RepCon VO is surface hard, shave the material to the desired final shape using a steel trowel. The maximum depth of neat repair mortar is 1.5” for each lift. Additional lifts can be placed after the original lift has achieved set. The original lift should be left with a rough surface to improve bond between lifts.Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to match the surrounding concrete. RepCon VO is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C-309 compliant, water-based SpecChem curing compound.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.
Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet).
As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
Mixing: Mix 6.25 – 6.75 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by the RepCon® V/O mix. Mix 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period. RepCon® V/O can be applied in applications from 1/4” to 2” in a lift.
Placement: Trowel RepCon® V/O firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. After the initial set, when RepCon® V/O is surface hard, shave the material to the desired final shape using a steel trowel. Maximum depth of neat repair mortar is 2” for each lift. Additional lifts can be placed after the original lift has achieved its final set. The original lift should be left with a rough surface to promote bonding between lifts.
Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to match the surrounding concrete. RepCon® V/O is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C309 compliant, water based SpecChem curing compound.","Surface Preparation: The concrete must be sound and free of all foreign material, including oil, grease, dust, laitance or other surface contaminants.

"SC Concrete Finish","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Surface Preparation: The surface must be structurally sound, clean, and free of dirt, release agents, efflorescence, curing compounds, laitance, and other contaminants. Remove form marks and other protrusions to prevent “show through”. Form a cove at the footer-wall intersection point and fill all broken corners of blocks and breaks in the surface. Repair all surface defects including cracks and voids with SC CONCRETE FINISH mixed to a mortar consistency. Cut back wires a minimum of 3/4” and repair with Spec Patch or Spec Plug. Dampen the surface with clean water immediately before SC CONCRETE FINISH application.
Mixing: SC CONCRETE FINISH must be mechanically mixed using a slow speed motor and mixing blade to thoroughly disperse the ingredients. Mix for approximately three minutes. Do not over-mix the material.
Pour approximately one half of the required 5 quarts (10 pints) into an empty, clean container and begin slow speed mixing.
Mixing liquid can be adjusted based on the type of application method.
Slowly add SC CONCRETE FINISH and mixing admixture* (water or StrongBond mixture) as needed to bring the mixture to a heavy, completely blended pancake batter consistency.
Stop mixing and allow the mixture to “fatten” for three minutes.
Re-mix and, if necessary, add more mixing liquid to the desired consistency.

Repair all surface defects including cracks and voids with SC FOUNDATION COATING mixed to a mortar consistency. Cut back wires a minimum of 3/4” and repair with Spec Patch or Spec Plug. Dampen the surface with clean water immediately before SC FOUNDATION COATING application.
Mixing: SC FOUNDATION COATING must be mechanically mixed using a slow speed motor and mixing blade to thoroughly disperse the ingredients. Mix for approximately three minutes. Do not over-mix the material.
Pour approximately one half of the required two gallons into an empty, clean container and begin slow speed mixing.
Slowly add SC FOUNDATION COATING and mixing admixture* (water or StrongBond mixture) as needed to bring the mixture to a heavy, completely blended pancake batter consistency.
Stop mixing and allow the mixture to “fatten” for three minutes.
Re-mix and, if necessary, add more mixing admixture to reduce batter consistency.
*Note: To improve bonding & mechanical properties on concrete, masonry and for all trowel applications, prepare an acrylic admixture using 1 part StrongBond and 3 parts potable water. For example, two gallons of mixing admixture consists of two quarts of StrongBond mixed together with six quarts of water. When using as a pointing mortar, the use of StrongBond admixture is recommended.
Application: Pre-dampen the substrate with clean, potable water before any application. All applications should carry down to and over the footer, forming a cove at the wall-footer intersection. Apply two uniform applications of SC Foundation Coating, each application at approximately 1-2 lbs/yd², allowing 24 hours between applications. Make sure both applications carry down to the junction of walls and footers.
Hand Brush: Apply using a six inch cement mason’s brush. Load bristles and lay on a heavy coat using long, smooth horizontal strokes. Apply sufficient material to fill all voids. Final strokes should all be in one direction to produce an even texture and finish. Allow first coat to dry for 12 to 24 hours before applying a finish coat.
Push Broom: Use a five gallon pail or wide mouth push broom to hold product. Dip a clean inch, Tampico bristle push broom into product mix just enough to load the bristles. Apply sufficient material to fill all voids, using even horizontal strokes. Apply sufficient material to fill all voids. Lift the brush at the end of each stroke and begin the next brush stroke with a new load of brush. Allow the first coat to dry for 12 to 24 hours before applying a finish coat.
Spray: Use heavy duty spray equipment capable of spraying cement-based products; sprayable consistency is required in some severe water pressure situations.
Trowel: The use of trowel applicators is required in some severe water pressure situations.","Surface Preparation: The surface must be structurally sound, clean, and free of dirt, release agents, efflorescence, curing compounds, laitance, and other contaminants. Remove form marks and other protrusions to prevent “show through”. Form a cove at the footer-wall intersection point and fill all broken corners of blocks and breaks in the surface. Repair all surface defects including cracks and voids with SC FOUNDATION COATING mixed to a mortar consistency. Cut back wires a minimum of 3/4” and repair with Spec Patch or Spec Plug. Dampen the surface with clean water immediately before SC FOUNDATION COATING application.
Mixing: SC FOUNDATION COATING must be mechanically mixed using a slow speed motor and mixing blade to thoroughly disperse the ingredients. Mix for approximately three minutes. Do not over-mix the material.
Pour approximately one half of the required two gallons into an empty, clean container and begin slow speed mixing.
Slowly add SC FOUNDATION COATING and mixing admixture* (water or StrongBond mixture) as needed to bring the mixture to a heavy, completely blended pancake batter consistency.
Stop mixing and allow the mixture to “fatten” for three minutes.
Re-mix and, if necessary, add more mixing admixture to reduce batter consistency.
*Note: To improve bonding & mechanical properties on concrete, masonry and for all trowel applications, prepare an acrylic admixture using 1 part StrongBond and 3 parts potable water. For example, two gallons of mixing admixture consists of two quarts of StrongBond mixed together with six quarts of water. When using as a pointing mortar, the use of StrongBond admixture is recommended.

Any metal in contact with grout must be free of rust, oil, grease, and other foreign matter which would limit bond. Concrete surface must be sound and roughened to ensure proper bonding. Prior to placing grout, the surface should be saturated surface dry (SSD) for an hour, if possible. Remove all excess water before placement of grout. Bolts, base plates, and equipment must be secure and rigid before placement of grout.Forms: Allow for the continuous placement of grout. Provisions for venting to avoid air entrapment must be made. Placing from one side, provide a 45° angle in the forms to a height suitable to provide a head of grout during placement. On all sides, provide a minimum of 1” (2.54 cm) horizontal clearance between the base plate and forms. Forms should be at least 1” (2.54 cm) higher than the bottom of the base plate.Mixing: Small quantities of grout may be hand-mixed in a concrete mixing pan until lump-free. For large quantities and continuous pours, mix using a mortar mixer with rubber-tipped blades or appropriate grout pump for a minimum of 5 minutes. Start with minimum water requirements. Always add water to the mixer first, then slowly add powder. Use only the amount of water required for the desired placement consistency.

For large quantities and continuous pours, mix using a mortar mixer with rubber-tipped blades or appropriate grout pump for a minimum of 5 minutes. Start with minimum water requirements. Always add water to the mixer first, then slowly add powder. Use only the amount of water required for the desired placement consistency. Mix in two steps: add 2/3 of the water, add grout, after partial mixing, add the remaining 1/3 of the water for the desired consistency. Thoroughly mix the total quantity for an additional 2-3 minutes. Do not mix more than can be placed in 30 minutes.Placing: Place continuously and quickly. Start from one side to avoid air entrapment. Be sure grout fills spaces and remains in contact with the plate. DO NOT VIBRATE. A minimum of 1” (2.48 cm) vertical clearance should be maintained for base plate grouting applications. Thinner vertical clearances may require the use of another type of grout.Curing: Immediately cover with clean, wet rags (do not use burlap) and keep moist until the final set. After the final set, remove rags and apply an ASTM-C-309 compliant curing compound, such as SpecChem Cure   Seal 25.Deep application: Pre-washed and graded 3/8” (1 cm) pea gravel must be used in applications thicker than 2” (1.5 cm). For:- 2”-5” (5.1-12.7 cm): Add 25% of 3/8” (1 cm) pea gravel per 50 lb bag of grout.- 5” (1.7 cm) and over: Add 50% of 3/8” (1 cm) pea gravel per 50 lb bag of grout. Place in 6” lifts with proper reinforcement.Hot weather conditions: Provide shade for the area to be grouted. Use cool or chilled mixing water. Protect grout from direct sun exposure for up to 24 hours after grouting. The maximum temperature (ambient and substrate) for grouting is 85°F (29°C). The maximum grout temperature should not exceed 80°F (27°C).Cold weather conditions: Raise the temperature of the area to be grouted with space heaters or steam. Warm the mixing water. Cover and insulate the grout to retain warmth. The minimum temperature (ambient, substrate, and grout) for grouting is 40°F (5°C).
Mix in two steps, adding water firstadd pea gravel for applications over 2"" thick.","SC METALLIC GROUT is a non-shrink, metallic, cement-based grout designed for industrial applications subjected to dynamic and repetitive loading.

Any metal in contact with grout must be free of rust, oil, grease, and other foreign matter that would limit bond. The concrete surface must be sound and roughened to ensure proper bonding. Prior to placing grout, the surface should be saturated for a minimum period of four hours, and preferably for twenty-four hours. Remove all excess water before placement of grout. Bolts, base plates, and equipment must be secure and rigid before placement of grout.Forms: Allow for the continuous placement of grout. Provisions for venting to avoid air entrapment must be made. Placing from one side, provide a 45° angle in the forms to a height suitable to provide a head of grout during placement. On all sides, provide a minimum 1” (2.54 cm) horizontal clearance between the base plate and forms. Forms should be at least 1” (2.54 cm) higher than the bottom of the base plate.Mixing: Small quantities of grout may be hand-mixed in a concrete mixing pan until lump-free. For large quantities and continuous pours, mix using a mortar mixer with rubber-tipped blades or appropriate grout pump for a minimum of 5 minutes. Start with minimum water requirements. Always add water to the mixer first, then slowly add powder. Use only the amount of water required for the desired placement consistency.Mix Water Guidelines (approximate water required per 50 lb bag):- Plastic: 6.30-6.85 pints- Flowable: 6.85-7.75 pints- Fluid: 7.75-8.35 pintsMix in two steps: Add 2/3 of the water, add grout, and after partial mixing, add the remaining 1/3 of the water for desired consistency. Thoroughly mix the total quantity for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. Do not mix more than can be placed in 30 minutes.Placing: Place continuously and quickly. Start from one side to avoid air entrapment. Be sure grout fills spaces and remains in contact with the plate. DO NOT VIBRATE. A minimum of 1” (2.48 cm) vertical clearance should be maintained for base plate grouting applications. Thinner vertical clearances may require another type of grout.Curing: Immediately cover with clean, wet rags (do not use burlap) and keep moist until the final set. After the final set, remove rags and apply an ASTM C309 curing compound, such as SpecChem Cure   Seal 25.

To assure proper adhesion, a field test should be performed to confirm performance. In general, if SpecPrime can achieve proper adhesion without peeling, then a SpecFlow overlay will be acceptable. Proper substrate preparation is essential. Consult SpecChem for further information.
PURPOSE: Sleek 1000 SLU can be used to level or smooth interior floors. It can be used on new construction projects to correct rough, unfinished, or uneven floors.
PREPARATION: To prepare surface, follow all standard ACI recommendations. Remove all dirt, gas, oil, grease, asphalt, paint, curing compounds, and all loose surface materials. Concrete substrates should be profiled to a minimum CSP#3, shot blasting is preferred.
PRIMING: Prime all surfaces with SpecPrime at approximately 100 - 150 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply with a brush or broom. Not for leave coverage will depend upon the condition and texture of the surface. Very porous surfaces will require two applications of primer. Allow SpecPrime to dry before applying Sleek 1000 SLU.
MIXING: Pour 5 1/2 quarts of water into a mixing vessel, then add one 50 pound bag of Sleek 1000 SLU. With a slow speed drill and a heavy duty mixing drill (650 rpm), mix for 2 to 3 minutes until mixture is smooth and free of lumps. Do not add more than 5 1/2 quarts of water per 50 pound bag. Over watering can cause separation and reduce strength. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period.
INSTALLATION: Pour Sleek 1000 SLU over the substrate spreading the material with a long handled spreader. SLEEK 1000 SLU can be pumped using an appropriately sized grout pump. For more information on grout pumps and pumping, please contact SpecChem.
No troweling is necessary. SLEEK 1000 SLU will level itself during the first 20 minutes at 70°F, and will accept foot traffic in 2-4 hours depending upon jobsite conditions. We recommend wearing cleated shoes when installing SLEEK 1000 SLU. Under normal conditions, floor coverings can be installed in 16-24 hours, depending on job site conditions. All flooring adhesives compatible with concrete may be used on SLEEK 1000 SLU.
Do not install Sleek 1000 SLU when the average daily temperature is less than 40°F. During hot weather, work quickly and use cold water for mixing, as the average working time will decrease.","SLEEK 1000 SLU can be applied over many different types of flooring and subfloors materials such as wood, sound mat, vinyl adhesive, cutback etc...

Do not overwork the surface or the aggregate may be driven down from the surface and the desired results may not be achieved. For added texture, spread extra aggregate on the surface and trowel or float into the surface, ensuring that each rock is completely surrounded by cement paste.
As soon as surface water has disappeared, evenly spray SpecEtch Deep over the entire area to be treated. Use an ordinary garden type sprayer and avoid puddles. Normal application rate is approximately 150 square feet per gallon. Cover the entire area with plastic sheeting (black is preferred). Ensure the edges are secure. Allow the concrete to cure 12 to 24 hours depending upon the temperature and other conditions. Periodically pull back the plastic and check a small area to determine the set of the concrete. Typical etch is 3/8” to 1/2”.
Once desired results are achieved, remove the plastic one section at a time and flush off the retarded concrete with a garden hose and stiff broom. A pressure washer may be used to wash the surface and expose the aggregate. Ensure that the water pressure flow is not excessive. Since equipment must be water immediate after use, use SpecChem SURFACE SHINE to protect and enhance the natural beauty of the exposed aggregate.
As jobsite conditions vary, a test panel should always be performed. Additional precautions, safety information and first aid are contained in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS).","SpecEtch Deep is a spray-applied, chemical surface retarder specially engineered to expose the underlying aggregate of freshly placed horizontal concrete.

It can be installed up to 5” in thickness with the addition of pea gravel. Floors subjected to high-load rubber-wheeled traffic require a minimum of 1/2”. SpecLevel PCT will develop a superior bond to the substrate and will normally accept foot traffic within 3 to 4 hours, depending upon heat, humidity, and other job site conditions.Preparation: To prepare the surface, follow all standard ACI recommendations. Remove all dirt, gas, oil, grease, asphalt, paint, curing compounds, and all loose surface materials. Concrete substrates should be profiled to a minimum CSP #4. Shot blasting is preferred.Priming: Prime all surfaces with SpecPoxy 1000 at approximately 100 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply with a notched squeegee, broom, or roller to assure complete coverage. Coverage will depend upon the condition and texture of the surface. While the epoxy is still wet (max. 30 min.), broadcast coarse dry sand (16/40 or minus 30 gradation) to the point of refusal (approximately 1 lb. of dry sand per sq ft). Allow to dry a minimum of 12 hours and remove any loose sand with a broom and vacuum before applying SpecLevel PCT.Mixing: Pour 7.5 pints of water into a mixing container, then add a 50-pound bag of SpecLevel PCT. Mix for a minimum of 3 minutes with a blending paddle attached to a heavy-duty drill (650 rpm) or a Helix Mixer until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps. To reduce flow for a thicker consistency, add 7 pints of water per 50 lbs of powder. Do not overwater or retemper. When mixing larger batches (3-4 bags in a large mixer), mix for a minimum of 4-5 minutes to ensure homogenous consistency. For pumping applications, mix for a minimum of 3 minutes in the pump’s mixing tank. SpecLevel PCT can be extended by adding 15 pounds of clean 3/8” pea gravel for each 50 pounds of product. First, mix SpecLevel PCT as instructed. During the last minute of mixing, add the required aggregate. Should a finish coat be required, apply a non-extended layer of SpecLevel PCT after the first extended layer has hardened and been re-primed with another layer of SpecPoxy 1000 and sand.Installation: Pour SpecLevel PCT over the substrate, spreading the material with a long-handled spreader or gauge rake. SpecLevel PCT can be pumped using an appropriately sized grout pump. No troweling is necessary. SpecLevel PCT will level itself during the first 20 minutes at 70°F and will accept foot traffic in 2-4 hours depending upon job site conditions. We recommend wearing cleated shoes when installing SpecLevel PCT. Do not install SpecLevel PCT when the average daily temperature is less than 45°F. During hot weather, work quickly and use cold water for mixing, as the average working time will decrease.

It can be installed up to 5” in thickness with the addition of pea gravel. Floors subjected to high-load rubber-wheeled traffic require a minimum of 1/2”. SpecLevel PCT-AGG will develop a superior bond to the substrate and will normally accept foot traffic within 3 to 4 hours depending upon heat, humidity, and other job site conditions.Preparation: To prepare the surface, follow all standard ACI recommendations. Remove all dirt, gas, oil, grease, asphalt, paint, curing compounds, and all loose surface materials. Concrete substrates should be profiled to a minimum CSP #4. Shot blasting is preferred.Priming: Prime all surfaces with SpecPoxy 1000 at approximately 100 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply with a notched squeegee, broom, or roller to assure complete coverage. Coverage will depend upon the condition and texture of the surface. While the epoxy is still wet (max. 30 min.), broadcast coarse dry sand (16/40 or minus 30 gradation) to the point of refusal (approximately 1 lb. of dry sand per sq ft). Allow to dry a minimum of 12 hours and remove any loose sand with a broom and vacuum before applying SpecLevel PCT-AGG.Mixing: Pour 7.5 pints of water into a mixing container, depending on desired consistency, then add a 50-pound bag of SpecLevel PCT-AGG. Mix for a minimum of 3 minutes with a blending paddle attached to a heavy-duty drill (650 rpm) or a Helix Mixer until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps. To reduce flow for a thicker consistency, add 6.5 pints of water per 50 lbs of powder. Do not overwater or retemper. When mixing larger batches (3-4 bags in a large mixer), mix for a minimum of 4-5 minutes to ensure a homogenous consistency. For pumping applications, mix for a minimum of 3 minutes in the pump’s mixing tank. SpecLevel PCT-AGG can be extended by adding 15 pounds of clean 3/8” pea gravel for each 50 pounds of product. First mix SpecLevel PCT-AGG as instructed. During the last minute of mixing, add the required aggregate. Should a finish coat be required, apply a non-extended layer of SpecLevel PCT-AGG after the first extended layer has hardened and been re-primed with another layer of SpecPoxy 1000 and sand.Installation: Pour SpecLevel PCT-AGG over the substrate, spreading the material with a long-handled spreader or gauge rake. SpecLevel PCT-AGG can be pumped using an appropriately sized grout pump. No troweling is necessary. SpecLevel PCT-AGG will level itself during the first 20 minutes at 70°F and will accept foot traffic in 2-4 hours depending upon job site conditions. We recommend wearing cleated shoes when installing SpecLevel PCT-AGG. Do not install SpecLevel PCT-AGG when the average daily temperature is less than 45°F. During hot weather, work quickly and use cold water for mixing, as the average working time will decrease.
SCAQMD Rule 1113 compliant","SpecLevel PCT-AGG is a cement-based, self-leveling polishable concrete topping pre-extended with a special aggregate that, when polished, creates an architectural natural polished concrete finish. SpecLevel PCT-AGG produces a dense, hard surface that can be diamond polished in as little as 24 hours.

Place the SpecPatch 30-Light mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.Placement: Trowel SpecPatch 30-Light firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Use slightly more material than is needed and roughly shape it during placement. After the initial set, when SpecPatch 30-Light is surface hard, shave the material to the desired final shape using a steel trowel. Maximum depth of neat repair mortar is 1” for each lift. Additional lifts can be placed after the original lift has set, leaving the surface rough to improve the bond between lifts.Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to match the texture of the surrounding concrete. SpecPatch 30-Light is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C-309-compliant, water-based SpecChem curing compound.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.
              
              Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet).
              
              SpecPatch Light takes its initial set in 15 minutes.
              
              Mixing: Mix 6.75 – 7.25 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by the SpecPatch Light. Mix 2 to 3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period. SpecPatch Light may be used with SpecChem Acrylic Bonder neat or mixed 1 to 1 with water per 50 pounds of powder to increase durability, abrasion resistance and bond strength. The addition of Acrylic Bonder is recommended when using SpecPatch Light in thin, horizontal applications subjected to heavy traffic or wear.
              
              Bond/Scrub Coat: Use the properly mixed SpecPatch Light as a bond or scrub coat by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the SpecPatch Light mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
              
              Placement: Trowel SpecPatch Light firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Use slightly more material than is needed and roughly shape during placement. After the initial set, when SpecPatch Light is surface hard, shave the material to the desired final shape using a steel trowel. Maximum depth of neat repair mortar is 1” for each lift. Additional lifts can be placed after the original lift has achieved set. The original lift should be left with a rough surface to improve bond between lifts.
              
              Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to match the surrounding concrete. SpecPatch Light is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C-309 compliant, water based SpecChem curing compound.","Surface Preparation: The concrete must be sound and free of all foreign material, including oil, grease, dust, laitance or other surface contaminants.

Pre-mix each component separately, then mix one part of Part A with one part of Part B for three minutes using a low-speed drill motor with a Jiffy mixer or paddle. Mix only as much material as can be used within the pot lifeSurface Preparation:  Surfaces to be bonded must be clean and structurally sound. Remove all oil, grease, dirt, laitance, curing compounds, and any other foreign material that may cause a problem with bonding. Abrasive blast cleaning and mechanical removal methods are recommended. All drilled holes must be cleaned out with a cylindrical bristle brush, removing all dust and loose material. Use clean, oil-free compressed air to blow out any remaining dust or debris prior to installation.Bonding: As a structural adhesive and bonding fresh concrete to hardened concrete, neatly apply SpecPoxy 2000 to the substrate with a brush, roller, or by spraying. SpecPoxy 2000 should be applied at the rate of 80 sq ft per gallon, or approximately 20 mils in thickness. While tacky, place the fresh concrete. If SpecPoxy 2000 is no longer tacky, remove any surface dirt or contaminants and apply another coat of product.Anchoring:  For use in anchoring dowels, bolts, reinforcing steel, etc., the depth of the hole should be approximately 9-15 times the bolt diameter. To provide optimum pull-out, the hole space (annulus) around the bolt should not exceed 1/8"". The annulus should not exceed 1/4"" without aggregate extension. Always dispense SpecPoxy 2000 into the anchoring hole, filling it from the bottom up. Insert the bolt or dowel by turning it slowly during insertion. The hole should be completely filled with epoxy and devoid of air pockets or voids.Patching Repairs: To produce a mortar for patching repairs, mix one to four parts by volume of clean, dry, well-graded silica sand to one part of SpecPoxy 2000. Mix thoroughly until all the sand is completely wet and evenly dispersed. Apply a prime coat over the area to be repaired with the neat mixed epoxy. Place the mortar, working it well into the surface before the prime coat becomes tack-free. Lifts should not exceed 1” in thickness.

Mix only as much material as can be used within the pot lifeSurface Preparation:  Surfaces to be bonded must be clean and structurally sound. Remove all oil, grease, dirt, laitance, curing compounds, and any other foreign material that may cause bonding problems. Optimum adhesion is achieved by creating an open, profiled/roughened surface, similar to coarse sandpaper. Shot-blasting or mechanical methods are recommended. Thoroughly vacuum up any remaining dust or debris prior to installationBroadcast Overlays:  Apply the neat SpecPoxy Bridge Overlay (SBO) with a 3/16” notched squeegee (approximately 32-64 sq ft per gallon, depending on specification). Then broadcast clean, dry aggregate after the epoxy coating has leveled out. A silica sand of 20-40 gradation is recommended for the broadcast aggregate. Apply the aggregate according to the specification or at a rate of 2 pounds per square foot, or to the point of rejection. After the SBO has cured hard, remove the excess aggregate and apply a second application if necessaryEpoxy Mortar:  Slowly add from 3.5 to 5 parts of clean, dry silica sand to one part of mixed SBO and mix thoroughly, completely wetting out all the sand with epoxy resin. For mortar overlays and patching, first clean and prime the prepared substrate with neat SBO. Then apply the epoxy mortar by trowel or vibrating screed while the primer coat is still tacky.

The concrete must be clean, dry, and sound. All oil, dirt, debris, paint, and unsound concrete must be removed. SpecPoxy Sealer is designed as a penetrating sealer. To ensure proper adhesion to a hard-troweled surface, a test section should be made to see if additional surface profiling (shotblasting/etching) is required.Mixing: All materials should be conditioned to a temperature of 55°F to 80°F. Mix parts A and B (resin and hardener) separately for one minute using a drill and mixing prop. Then mix Part A and Part B together for three minutes. The epoxy must be well mixed to ensure proper chemical reaction. Once mixed, immediately apply to the surface.Placement: This product may be applied by squeegee, roller, or industrial sprayer. When applying to seal hairline cracks, flood coat the surface and let the material pool over cracked areas for five minutes to ensure the cracks are filled. Squeegee or broom away any excess material from the surface. For improved skid resistance, broadcast clean, dry silica sand to refusal immediately after excess sealer has been removed from the surface. After the initial cure, remove excess sand. Due to variations in the porosity of concrete surfaces, SpecPoxy Sealer may create an irregular amber appearance if not applied uniformly. If desired, additional coats of this product may be applied after the initial sealer has become tack-free. This could be as early as six hours but must be within 12 hours of initial placement.

The substrate must be structurally sound and free of laitance, grease, oil, dirt, or any other contaminants that may adversely affect the bond. The prepared surface must be dust-free and have a sufficient profile to ensure adequate mechanical lock.Mixing and Application Guidelines: Agitate well before use.Bonding Agent: Apply a uniform coating of undiluted PLASTER BOND at 250 sq ft per gallon to the prepared surface by brush, roller, or sprayer. If spray applied, brush or broom into the substrate, forming a continuous film over the entire area to be bonded. The coverage rate varies with the porosity of the surface. Drying time is 20-30 minutes at 70°F. PLASTER BOND will remain slightly tacky when dry. Accumulation in low areas should be wiped up. Poor ventilation will delay normal drying time. Fans will help increase air circulation to speed drying time. Under normal conditions, PLASTER BOND can be applied up to 24 hours before the installation of underlayment toppings. All areas subject to application must be clean of all foreign materials. Traffic should be kept to a minimum. Very porous surfaces will require two applications of Bond-Abell. Allow 1-2 hours between applications. If a continuous film is not achieved on the surface, reapply PLASTER BOND.Place plaster or stucco within 24 hours. The application instructions highlight typical conditions. (When in doubt, always apply a test patch.)

","Surface Preparation: Mechanically abrade the existing substrate to remove all unsound concrete. The substrate must be structurally sound and free of laitance, grease, oil, dirt, or any other contaminants that may adversely affect the bond. The prepared surface must be dust-free and have a sufficient profile to ensure adequate mechanical lock.Mixing and Application Guidelines: Agitate well before use.Bonding Agent: Apply a uniform coating of undiluted PLASTER BOND at 250 sq ft per gallon to the prepared surface by brush, roller, or sprayer. If spray applied, brush or broom into the substrate, forming a continuous film over the entire area to be bonded. The coverage rate varies with the porosity of the surface. Drying time is 20-30 minutes at 70°F. PLASTER BOND will remain slightly tacky when dry. Accumulation in low areas should be wiped up. Poor ventilation will delay normal drying time. Fans will help increase air circulation to speed drying time. Under normal conditions, PLASTER BOND can be applied up to 24 hours before the installation of underlayment toppings. All areas subject to application must be clean of all foreign materials. Traffic should be kept to a minimum. Very porous surfaces will require two applications of Bond-Abell. Allow 1-2 hours between applications. If a continuous film is not achieved on the surface, reapply PLASTER BOND.Place plaster or stucco within 24 hours.

Do not allow the accumulation of water, dirt or other contaminants. As a water based product, phasing will occur over time. Agitate well before each use.
Coverage: Ready-to-use. Do not dilute. Form surfaces should be clean of dirt, rust, scale and concrete build up prior to application. Spray application of SpecStrip WB is recommended with coverage as follows:
Steel, Plastic, Fiberglass 1000 sq ft/gal
Conditioned Aluminum 1000 sq ft/gal
HDO Plywood 1000 sq ft/gal
MDO Plywood 1000 sq ft/gal
Dimensional Lumber 1000 sq ft/gal
BB Grade Plywood 1000 sq ft/gal
Actual application rates depend on the porosity of form surface.
SpecStrip WB should be spray applied using an atomizing or misting spray tip so that application may be in thin uniform films to maximize product performance and economy. Over-application will not produce better results and may cause dusting.
Excess material or puddles should be removed with a squeegee and absorbent rags.
When properly applied, SpecStrip WB will not leave any residue or stain on the concrete, producing a smooth, architectural concrete surface ready for subsequent coatings. Coating manufacturer’s recommendations for surface preparations must be followed.
SpecStrip WB sprays easily. Proper application substantially reduces concrete surfaces voids and extends the life of wood forms.","SpecStrip WB is a reactive water-based release agent for all types of concrete forms. Forms treated with SpecStrip WB release easily while minimizing the number of bug holes. SpecStrip WB will not damage styrene bead or form liners. It leaves a coating on steel forms that inhibits rust. May contribute to LEED credits.
SpecStrip WB:
• Improves release of formwork
• Reduces concrete buildup on formwork and liners
• Reduces cleaning of formwork
• Protects formwork against rust
• Leaves no residue, stain or discoloration

This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels. The use of SpecChem “IntraFilm” as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.

Curing New Concrete: Ready-to-use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, SpecTilt EX should be applied immediately after the final steel troweling, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results. The entire slab must be completely covered. When applied on tightly steel troweled concrete, SpecTilt EX meets the moisture retention requirements of ASTM C-309. Typical application for curing is 200-400 sq-ft/gal.

Bondbreaker Coat: Casting slab must be properly cured, smooth, and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. SpecTilt EX should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply at 400 sq ft per gallon or to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gallon. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bond breaker.

This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels. The use of SpecChem “IntraFilm” as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.

Curing New Concrete: SpecTilt WB must be mixed or agitated before each use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, SpecTilt WB should be applied immediately after the final hard steel troweling at 250-350 sq ft per gal. after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results.

Bond Breaker Coat: Casting slab must be well cured, smooth and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. SpecTilt WB should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply @ 400 sq ft per gal or to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gal. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bondbreaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet affected areas with water to fill concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply SpecTilt WB. Allow bondbreaker to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is thoroughly dry.

Bond Breaker Coat on Old or Water Cured Concrete: Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds, salts or other substances that could adversely affect the performance of SpecTilt WB. The slab must be smooth, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels, flood casting slab surface with clean water. Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply SpecTilt WB to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Allow to thoroughly dry. As before, if light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary.

SpecWeld has a coverage rate of 150-250 square feet per gallon. The coverage rate varies with the porosity of the surface. Apply with a brush, broom or sprayer and brush into the surface. Drying time is two to three hours at 70°F. SpecWeld will remain slightly tacky when dry. Accumulation in low areas should be wiped up. Poor ventilation will delay normal drying time. Fans will help increase air circulation to speed drying time.
Under normal conditions, SpecWeld can be applied up to 10 days before installation of toppings, provided the coated surface is clean and free of all foreign materials. Traffic should be kept to a minimum.
Very porous surfaces will require two applications of SpecWeld. Allow two to three hours between applications. If a continuous film is not achieved on the surface, reapply SpecWeld.

Bonding admixture for cement-based mortars/stucco: Replace one half of mixing water with SpecWeld. Mix as usual. Properties achieved when using SpecWeld as an admixture will depend on composition of the stucco/mortar. Verify suitability in each application prior to application. Modifying with SpecWeld will improve the adhesion and durability of cement based mortars/toppings.","SpecWeld is a ready-to-use, rewettable polyvinyl acetate (PVA) emulsion admixture and bonding agent which bonds new concrete, underlayments, masonry, stucco, terrazzo and Portland cement/sand mixes to horizontal and vertical concrete surfaces.

Surface should be dry before applying stripper. All glass, metal and painted surfaces should be protected from exposure during the stripping process using polyethylene or other proven protective material. Pedestrian and auto traffic should be diverted and/or protected. Beware of wind drift. Adjacent shrubs and plants should be protected from direct contact.
*Note: SpecChem Stripper Supreme will not attack glass surfaces, however cleaning is normally necessary following coating removal and cleaning solution may damage glass surfaces.

Test Application: SpecChem suggests test panels to be applied prior to overall application to determine precise cleaning procedures and assure desired results. Testing should be oriented towards determining the optimum “dwell time” for the product and the number of applications necessary to completely remove all traces of the coating from the surface.

Application: Apply a thick coat of Stripper Supreme with a synthetic or natural fiber brush, roller or airless sprayer. Sprayers should be fitted with viton, Teflon or other resistant seals or hoses. A minimum one gallon per minute (50 psi) (0.34 MPa) airless sprayer is recommended. If thinning is desirable, dilute with SpecChem Solvent 100.
1. Prepare the surface by thoroughly dry scraping or high pressure spraying to remove all loose or peeling coating. Allow to thoroughly dry if water pressure is used.
2. Apply a thick coating of Stripper Supreme on the surface using a natural fiber brush, roller or (airless) spray equipment.
3. Leave Stripper Supreme on the surface until the desired coating “lifts” or shows indication of dissolving. Stripper Supreme should be left on the surface for a total of 15 to 30 minutes before rinsing.
*Note: Stripper Supreme should not be allowed to dry on the surface. If tests indicate long waiting periods, additional amounts of Stripper Supreme should be applied to prevent drying out.
4. Periodically agitate the Stripper Supreme while on the surface using a stiff bristle brush to improve penetration in the coating.
5. Remove Stripper Supreme and coating residues using high pressure rinsing equipment (400 to 600 psi) (2.8-4.1 MPa) or a garden hose with adjustable nozzle. Adjust the nozzle to provide a concentrated stream of water and flush the Stripper Supreme thoroughly from the surface.
6. Disposal of Stripper Supreme: Contact local, state and federal authorities regarding procedure for proper disposal.
7. Before applying sealers such as SpecChem Deco Shine, Crystal Shine, or Surface Shine, all Stripper Supreme residue must be completely removed. An application of Citrus Cleaner, when used in accordance with the written instructions, is an efficient low cost method of removing all stripper residue.
*Note: High pressure cleaning equipment is recommended for water rinsing the Stripper Supreme and residues from the treated surface. Masonry surfaces are porous and high pressure water (fan spray) may be necessary to thoroughly flush the pigments from the pore of the masonry. Equipment providing adjustable pressure between 400 to 1200 psi (2.8-8.3 MPa) at four to eight gallons per minute is recommended. Hot water (150°F (65°C)) will improve the efficiency of the stripping operation but is not necessary for good results.","Surface Preparation: Prepare the surface by removing loose, peeling coating using high water pressure or by scraping.

Substrate must be structurally sound and free of laitance, grease, oil, dirt or any other contaminants that may adversely affect the bond. Prepared surface must be dust-free and must have sufficient profile to ensure adequate mechanical lock.

Mixing and Application Guidelines: Agitate well before use.

Bonding Agent: Apply a uniform coating of undiluted STUCCO BOND at 250 sq-ft per gallon to the prepared surface by brush, roller or sprayer. If spray applied, brush or broom into the substrate. Place concrete, mortar, or stucco within 24 hours. Reapply STUCCO BOND if stucco, mortar or concrete placement exceeds 24 hrs. The application instructions highlight typical conditions. (When in doubt, always apply a test patch).

Admixture: When used as an admixture, STUCCO BOND should be diluted 1 to 1 with potable water to facilitate mixing with various sand/cement mixtures. Mix designs vary with specific job requirements. Proportioning of sand, cement and STUCCO BOND (diluted) ratios achieve different physical properties. Typically, blend one part cement to three parts sand then add enough diluted STUCCO BOND until a desired consistency is achieved. Blue tint will fade as cement/sand mix hydrate, not effecting the final color of the mortar. To avoid trapping air, do not over-mix. Place modified mortar/repair material and finish appropriately, taking care not to overwork the material.","Surface Preparation: Mechanically abrade existing substrate to remove all unsound concrete.

If roller applied, use a short napped solvent resistant sleeve to avoid whipping air bubbles into sealer. When an extra high-gloss is desired or on especially porous surfaces, another thin application can be applied the next day at 400 sq-ft per gal. Two thin coats will produce a better gloss than one heavy coat, especially on porous substrates.
Existing Concrete: Concrete surface must be clean, dry, and free of all stains, oil, grease, dirt, and incompatible coatings prior to application. Coverage may vary due to porosity and conditions of the concrete.

As the porosity of exposed aggregate, brick, and other surfaces varies greatly, test panels should be made to determine the suitability of this product and the number of coats required to achieve the desired results. An application of SURFACE SHINE EX will renovate existing concrete, brick or terrazzo floors. These surfaces will be brighter and easier to clean and maintain.","Surface Shine EX is a VOC-compliant, high-gloss methacrylate polymer designed to cure and seal exterior surfaces like exposed aggregate, natural stone, brick, quarry tile, terrazzo, stamped concrete, and other concrete surfaces. It is formulated with a unique solvent blend that ensures fast-drying, solvent-based performance and VOC compliance in OTC/LADCO/MRPO regions. The actual VOC content is 348 grams per liter.","Dispose of contents and containers in accordance with local, regional, national, and international regulations.","","","IF ON SKIN: Rinse skin with water. Remove contaminated clothing. If skin irritation occurs, seek medical attention. If swallowed, call a POISON CENTER or doctor immediately. Do NOT induce vomiting.","","224.0","","Do not use as a base for cementitious materials. Use caution when applying around fountains, pools, or on concrete subject to hydrostatic pressure.

TOTAL PATCH is a fast setting product, so mixing equipment should be cleaned with water as soon as possible. Use only potable water for mixing.
Application range 40°F to 90°F. Please consult SpecChem for special instructions on any application outside this temperature range.
Adverse Weather Application: In adverse temperatures, follow ACI recommendations for hot/cold weather concreting practices. For optimum results, condition bagged material to between 65°F and 85°F overnight.
Cold Weather applications should follow procedures outlined in ACI 306. Conditioning the material before mixing to 65°F and 85°F, heating the repair area, using warm water for mixing, and tenting or insulating the patch area after application will increase strength development. Do not use direct, unvented heat on the patch after installation. Do not allow repairs to freeze until the material has reached a minimum of 1000 psi compressive strength.
Caution: Contains Portland cement and sand. Cement will cause irritation. Avoid contact. A dust respirator, safety goggles, and rubber gloves are recommended. Avoid prolonged contact with clothing. In case of contact with eyes, immediately flush with water for at least 15 minutes. Get prompt medical attention. Do not wear contact lenses when working with this product. DO NOT take internally. Keep out of reach of children.
Avoid hazards by following all precautions found in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), product labels, and technical literature. Please read this information prior to using the product.","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fcorrosion.png?alt=media&token=2f651653-221f-45a8-9a02-feba14900d9e; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fexclamation.png?alt=media&token=a0120ae4-b4d0-482c-aca9-1400dbd294b9; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fhealth-hazard.png?alt=media&token=6afae00b-0abb-47d6-9740-364dd060e28e","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fcorrosion.png?alt=media&amp;token=2f651653-221f-45a8-9a02-feba14900d9e; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fexclamation.png?alt=media&amp;token=a0120ae4-b4d0-482c-aca9-1400dbd294b9; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fhealth-hazard.png?alt=media&amp;token=6afae00b-0abb-47d6-9740-364dd060e28e","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fcorrosion.png?alt=media&amp;token=2f651653-221f-45a8-9a02-feba14900d9e; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fexclamation.png?alt=media&amp;token=a0120ae4-b4d0-482c-aca9-1400dbd294b9; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fhealth-hazard.png?alt=media&amp;token=6afae00b-0abb-47d6-9740-364dd060e28e","https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fcorrosion.png?alt=media&amp;token=2f651653-221f-45a8-9a02-feba14900d9e; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fexclamation.png?alt=media&amp;token=a0120ae4-b4d0-482c-aca9-1400dbd294b9; https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/specchem-pwa-feb-25.firebasestorage.app/o/pictograms%2Fhealth-hazard.png?alt=media&amp;token=6afae00b-0abb-47d6-9740-364dd060e28e","","","","Shelf life of unopened bags stored in a dry facility is 12 months.

Climate (temperature) and mix design are key variables that need to be considered for a successful project.
Mix VERSA ETCH thoroughly before each use. Prior to use, protect surrounding surfaces, concrete walks, curbs, etc from overspray and wash down residue.
Place concrete and float, screed or trowel level. For added texture, spread extra aggregate on the surface and trowel or float into the surface, ensuring that each rock is completely surrounded by cement paste.
As soon as surface water has disappeared, use a plastic sprayer and evenly spray a thorough coat of VERSA ETCH over the entire area to be treated. Normal application rate is approximately 200-300 square feet per gallon. Do not apply too sparingly. Versa Etch will dry in 1-2 hours depending on ambient conditions.
Once the VERSA ETCH feels dry to the touch, apply VERSA ETCH EXTENDER over the top of VERSA ETCH. This will help create a more uniform etch and extend the removal time of the VERSA ETCH, especially in hot weather. Coverage for Versa Etch Extender is approximately 400 sq ft per gal.
Anywhere from 6 hours to 24 hours later, flush off the retarded and extender from the concrete with a garden hose and stiff broom, a pressure washer, or a garden hose and floor scrubber with stiff bristle pad. Ensure that the pressure washer force is not excessive. Rinse equipment with water immediately after use.
Follow up with one of SpecChem’s penetrating or decorative sealers to protect concrete at the end.
A small mock-up, adjacent to the project, applied and finished with the same mix design, conditions and techniques can be very helpful in determining the proper timing and procedures for a successful application.","As jobsite conditions and mix designs (min. 3500 psi) vary, a test panel should always be performed to determine the proper grade of retarder to achieve the desired depth of etch.

Climate (temperature) and mix design are key variables that need to be considered for a successful project.
Mix VERSA ETCH thoroughly before each use. Prior to use, protect surrounding surfaces, concrete walks, curbs, etc from overspray and wash down residue.
Place concrete and float, screed or trowel level. For added texture, spread extra aggregate on the surface and trowel or float into the surface, ensuring that each rock is completely surrounded by cement paste.
As soon as surface water has disappeared, use a plastic sprayer and evenly spray a thorough coat of VERSA ETCH over the entire area to be treated. Normal application rate is approximately 200-300 square feet per gallon. Do not apply too sparingly. Versa Etch will dry in 1-2 hours depending on ambient conditions.
Once the VERSA ETCH feels dry to the touch, apply VERSA ETCH EXTENDER over the top of VERSA ETCH. This will help create a more uniform etch and extend the removal time of the VERSA ETCH, especially in hot weather. Coverage for Versa Etch Extender is approximately 400 sq ft per gal.
Anywhere from 6 hours to 24 hours later, flush off the retarded and extender from the concrete with a garden hose and stiff broom, a pressure washer, or a garden hose and floor scrubber with stiff bristle pad. Ensure that the pressure washer force is not excessive. Rinse equipment with water immediately after use.
Follow up with one of SpecChem’s penetrating or decorative sealers to protect concrete at the end.

Mix VERSA ETCH thoroughly before each use. Prior to use, protect surrounding surfaces, concrete walks, curbs, etc from overspray and wash down residue.
Place concrete and float, screed or trowel level. For added texture, spread extra aggregate on the surface and trowel or float into the surface, ensuring that each rock is completely surrounded by cement paste.
As soon as surface water has disappeared, use a plastic sprayer and evenly spray a thorough coat of VERSA ETCH over the entire area to be treated. Normal application rate is approximately 200-300 square feet per gallon. Do not apply too sparingly. Versa Etch will dry in 1-2 hours depending on ambient conditions.
Once the VERSA ETCH feels dry to the touch, apply VERSA ETCH EXTENDER over the top of VERSA ETCH. This will help create a more uniform etch and extend the removal time of the VERSA ETCH, especially in hot weather. Coverage for Versa Etch Extender is approximately 400 sq ft per gal.

","Ready to use. Do not thin. New concrete/Exposed aggregate sealer: Apply with a sprayer or roller in uniform, thin films; spray application for best results. Only one coat of Aqua Shine is needed to cure, seal, beautify, and protect. For increased gloss, a second coat may be applied. Allow the first coat to thoroughly dry before applying the second coat, typically 6-8 hours. Two thin coats will produce a better gloss than one heavy coat, especially on porous substrates.Existing concrete: Concrete surface must be clean, dry, and free of all stains, oil, grease, dirt, and incompatible coatings prior to application. Apply in accordance with recommended coverage rates.
