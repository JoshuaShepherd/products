immediately. When symptoms persist or in all cases of doubt seek medical
advice.
Eye contact : In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15
minutes. If easy to do, remove contact lens, if worn. Get medical attention.
Inhalation : If inhaled, remove to fresh air. Get medical attention if symptoms occur.
Skin contact : In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least 15
minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical attention.
Wash clothing before reuse. Thoroughly clean shoes before reuse.
Ingestion : If swallowed, DO NOT induce vomiting. Get medical attention if symptoms occur.
Rinse mouth thoroughly with water.
Most important symptoms/effects, acute and delayed
Potential acute health effects
Causes skin irritation. Causes serious eye irritation. Suspected of damaging fertility or the unborn
child.
Protection of first-aiders:
First Aid responders should pay attention to self-protection, and use the recommended personal
protective equipment when the potential for exposure exists.
Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed, if necessary
Notes to physician : Treat symptomatically and supportively.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES

| Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures: |

Safety Data Sheet
SpecSilane 20 WB
Version 1 pg. 4
Use personal protective equipment. Follow safe handling advice and personal protective equipment
recommendations.
Environmental Precautions:
Discharge into the environment must be avoided.
Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.
Prevent spreading over a wide area (e.g. by containment or oil barriers). Retain and dispose of
contaminated wash water. Local authorities should be advised if significant spillages cannot be
contained.
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up:
Soak up with inert absorbent material. For large spills, provide diking or other appropriate
containment to keep material from spreading. If diked material can be pumped, store recovered
material in appropriate container. Clean up remaining materials from spill with suitable absorbent.
Local or national regulations may apply to releases and disposal of this material, as well as those
materials and items employed in the cleanup of releases. You will need to determine which
regulations are applicable. Sections 13 and 15 of this SDS provide information regarding
certain local or national requirements.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions for Safe Handling:
Technical measures: See Engineering measures under EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL
PROTECTION section.
Local/Total ventilation: Use only with adequate ventilation.
Advice on safe handling: Do not get on skin or clothing. Avoid inhalation of vapor or mist. Do not
swallow. Do not get in eyes. Handle in accordance with good industrial
hygiene and safety practice. Keep away from water. Protect from moisture.
Take care to prevent spills, waste and minimize release to the
environment.
Conditions for safe storage: Keep in properly labeled containers. Store in accordance with the
particular national regulations.
Materials to avoid: Do not store with the following product types: Strong oxidizing agents

Further information
Ingredients:
Triethoxyoctylsilane:
Remarks: Findings from a combined repeated-dose toxicity study with reproductive/ developmental
screening endpoints on n-octyltriethoxysilane have shown neurological effects
in rats at high doses (1000 mg/kg). Paralysis and paresis of the limbs, and demyelination of
the brain, spinal cord, sciatic and tibial nerves was noted in some animals.
Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane:
Remarks: Results from a 2 year repeated vapor inhalation exposure study to rats of
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) indicate effects (benign uterine adenomas) in the uterus of female
animals. This finding occurred at the highest exposure dose (700 ppm) only. Studies to date have
not demonstrated if these effects occur through pathways that are relevant to humans. Based on
the available information on its potential to cause harm to human health, Health Canada, in a
2008 screening assessment, has concluded that octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane is not entering the
environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a
danger in Canada to human life or health
(http://www.ec.gc.ca/eseees/default.asp?lang=En&n=2481B508-1). Repeated exposure in rats to D4
resulted in protoporphyrin accumulation in the liver. Without knowledge of the specific mechanism
leading to the protoporphyrin accumulation the relevance of this finding to humans is unknown.

Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane:
Results of PBT and vPvB assessment: Remarks: Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) meets the
current REACh Annex XIII criteria for PBT and vPvB. In
Canada, D4 has been assessed and deemed to meet
the PiT criteria. However, D4 does not behave similarly
to known PBT/vPvB substances. The weight of scientific
evidence from field studies shows that D4 is not
biomagnifying in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. D4 in
air will degrade by reaction with naturally occurring
hydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. Any D4 in air that
does not degrade by reaction with hydroxyl radicals is
not expected to deposit from the air to water, to land, or
to living organisms.
