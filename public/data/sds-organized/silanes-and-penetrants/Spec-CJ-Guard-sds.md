SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Fire Extinguishing Media: The product itself does not burn in solution. dry polymer: Use dry
chemical, carbon dioxide, alcohol-resistant foam or water spray.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not scatter spilled material with high-pressure water streams.
Specific Hazards in Case of Fire: Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide.
Thermal Decomposition: To avoid thermal decomposition, do not overheat. Thermal
decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors.
Special Fire Fighting Information: Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny
entry. Do not enter confined spaces unless adequately
ventilated. Cool containers with water spray until well after the
fire is out. Keep away from heat, sparks and flame. Wear full
protective fire fighting gear including self contained breathing
apparatus (SCBA) for protection against possible exposure.
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
Personal Precautions: Keep unnecessary people away, isolate hazard area and deny
entry. The mixture is slippery when wet. Avoid contact with skin
and eyes.
Environmental Precautions: Prevent environmental discharge consistent with regulatory
requirements.
Methods and Materials for
Containment and Cleaning up: Use approved industrial vacuum cleaner for removal. Absorb
spillage to prevent material damage. Collect in closed and
suitable containers for disposal.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for Safe Handling: Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Spilled polymer
solution is very slippery. Use care to avoid falls. Wash thoroughly
after handling.
Conditions for Safe Storage,
Including any Incompatibilities: None needed according to classification criteria. Protect from
freezing. Store at room temperature. Store in original container.
Incompatible Materials: Oxidizing agents, acids, peroxides, perchlorates, nitrates,
reactive metals
