Balance of other ingredients are non-hazardous or less than 1% in concentration (or 0.1% for carcinogens, reproductive toxins, or
respiratory sensitizers).
Note: All WHMIS required information is included in appropriate sections based on the ANSI Z400.1-2010 format.
This product has been classified in accordance with the hazard criteria of the CPR and the MSDS contains all the
information required by the CPR, EU Directives and the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS Z 7250:2000
SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
Inhalation: Remove to fresh air if effects occur. If not breathing, give artificial
respiration. If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by
qualified personnel. Consult a physician or transport to a medical facility.
Eye Contact: Immediately flush eyes with large quantities of water for at least 15
minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes,
then continue flushing eyes for at least 15 minutes. Obtain medical
attention without delay, preferably from an ophthalmologist. Suitable
emergency eye wash facility should be immediately available.
Skin Contact: Wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and flowing water. Remove
contaminated clothing while washing. Seek medical attention if irritation
persists. An MDI skin decontamination study demonstrated that cleaning
very soon after exposure is important, and that a polyglycol-based skin
cleanser or corn oil may be more effective than soap and water.
Ingestion: If swallowed, seek medical attention. Do not induce vomiting unless
directed to do so by medical personnel.
Notes to Physician: No specific antidote. Treatment of exposure should be directed at the
control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. Maintain
adequate ventilation and oxygenation of the patient. May cause
respiratory sensitization or asthma-like symptoms. Bronchodilators,
expectorants and antitussives may be of help. Treat bronchospasm with
inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. Respiratory
symptoms, including pulmonary edema, may be delayed. Persons
receiving significant exposure should be observed 24-48 hours for signs
of respiratory distress. If you are sensitized to diisocyanates, consult
your physician regarding working with other respiratory irritants or
sensitizers. Cholinesterase inhibition has been noted in human exposure
but is not of benefit in determining exposure and is not correlated with
signs of exposure. Treatment of exposure should be directed at the
control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. Excessive
exposure may aggravate preexisting asthma and other respiratory
disorders (e.g. emphysema, bronchitis, reactive airways dysfunction
syndrome).

SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Flash Point: 230° C (446° F)
Flammable Properties: Product is not considered a fire hazard, but will burn if ignited.
NFPA Flammability Class: III B (Combustible liquid).
Suitable Extinguishing Media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical, water fog or fine spray. Alcohol resistant
foams are preferred, general purpose synthetic foams or protein foams may function, but will not be
as effective.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use direct water stream, as it may spread fire.
Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Product reacts with water. Reaction may produce heat and/or
gases. This reaction may be violent. Container may rupture from gas generation in a fire situation.
Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids.
Dense smoke is produced when product burns.
Products of Combustion: Thermal decomposition in the presence of air may yield carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, phenolics, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, isocyanates, hydrogen cyanide and other
unidentified toxic and/or irritating compounds.
Fire Fighting: Stay upwind and keep people away. Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry. Keep out
of low areas where gases (fumes) can accumulate. Water is not recommended, but may be applied in
large quantities as a fine spray when other extinguishing agents are not available. Fight fire from
protected location or safe distance. Consider the use of unmanned hose holders or monitor nozzles.
Immediately withdraw all personnel from the area in case of rising sound from venting safety device
or discoloration of the container. Move container from fire area if this is possible without hazard. Use
water spray to cool fire-exposed containers and fire-affected zone until fire is out. Contain fire water
run-off if possible, as it may cause environmental damage. Review section 6 and section 12 of this
SDS.
Protection of Firefighters: Wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and
approved protective clothing (helmet, coat, trousers, boots and gloves). If contact is likely, use full
chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with SCBA.
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
Personal Precautions: Put on appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8).
Environmental Precautions: Prevent spilled material from contact with soil, drains and sewers.
Methods for Containment: Contain by diking with sand, earth or other suitable material.
Methods for Clean-up: Absorb spill with an inert material, use non-sparking tools to place into labeled
waste container for disposal.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Handling: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (see section 8). Avoid contact with skin,
eyes or clothing. Do not breathe vapor or mist. Do not ingest. Avoid prolonged or repeated contact

with skin. May cause allergic skin reaction, persons with a history of skin sensitization should not be
employed in any process in which this product is used. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after
handling. Do not handle or store near flame, heat or strong oxidants. Keep away from sources of
ignition and hot metal surfaces.
Storage: Store original unopened containers in a sheltered area between 60°F and 80°F (15°C and
27°C) at atmospheric pressure. Do not store in direct sunlight. Keep containers closed when not in
use.
SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
8.1 Exposure Parameters:
Chemical Name / CAS No. OSHA Exposure Limits ACGIH Exposure Limits Other Exposure Limits
NIOSH: 0.005 ppm TWA
(listed under Methylene
0.005 ppm TWA (listed
4,4’-methylenediphenyl bisphenyl isocyanate);
Not Established under Methylene
diisocyanate 101-68-8 0.05 mg/m3 TWA
bisphenyl isocyanate (MDI))
0.020 ppm Ceiling (10 min);
0.2 mg/m3 Ceiling (10 min)
Engineering Controls: General mechanical ventilation is sufficient for most conditions. Control
airborne levels below the exposure guidelines, if established.
Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations.
General Hygiene Considerations: Wash thoroughly after handling and before eating, drinking or
smoking.
Eye/face Protection: Use chemical safety glasses, splash-proof eye goggles or goggles with full
faceshield.
Skin Protection: Use neoprene, nitrile/butadiene rubber or other impermeable chemical resistant
gloves to prevent skin irritation. If potential for skin contact is present, wear impervious, long-sleeved,
body covering clothing and rubber boots.
Respiratory Protection: If exposure may or does exceed occupational exposure limits, respiratory
irritation is experienced, or during spray application, use a properly fitted MSHA/NIOSH approved
respirator fitted with organic vapor cartridges and particulate pre-filters. If the respirator is the sole
means of protection, use a full-face supplied air respirator. For situations where the atmospheric
levels may exceed the level for which an air-purifying respirator is effective, use an approved positive-
pressure air-supplying respirator (air line or self-contained breathing apparatus). If sanding or grinding
on cured material, use above respirator fitted with HEPA filters or a dust mask.
Contaminated Gear: Remove contaminated clothing and shoes while washing. Wash clothing before
reuse. Discard items which cannot be decontaminated, including leather articles such as shoes, belts
and watchbands.

Chemical Stability: Stable under recommended storage conditions (see Section 7).
Conditions to Avoid: Avoid temperatures above 450 deg F (230 deg C), potential violent decomposition may
occur. Avoid contact with water, as material reacts with water, releasing carbon dioxide which can cause
rapid pressure buildup and rupture of closed containers. Elevated temperatures accelerate this reaction.
Incompatible Materials: Strong acids, bases, or oxidizing agents. Avoid unintended contact with amines,
alcohols, water, moist air and metals such as aluminum, brass, copper, tin, zinc and galvanized metals.
Products of Combustion: Thermal decomposition in the presence of air may yield carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, phenolics, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, isocyanates, hydrogen cyanide and other unidentified toxic
and/or irritating compounds.
Hazardous polymerization will not occur.
