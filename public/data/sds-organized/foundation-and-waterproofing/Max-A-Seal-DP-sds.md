Safety Data Sheet
according to Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 58 / Monday, March 26, 2012 / Rules and Regulations
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1. Precautions for safe handling
Precautions for safe handling : Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or
smoking and when leaving work. Provide good ventilation in process area to prevent formation
of vapor. Avoid breathing vapors. Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all
safety precautions have been read and understood.
Hygiene measures : Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the workplace. Wash contaminated
clothing before reuse.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Storage conditions : Keep only in the original container in a cool, well ventilated place away from oxidizers,
excessive heat, and open flame. Keep container closed when not in use. Do not freeze.
