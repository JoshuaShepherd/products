Inhalation: Remove to fresh air if effects occur. If not breathing, give artificial
respiration. If breathing is difficult, oxygen should be administered by
qualified personnel. Consult a physician or transport to a medical facility.
Eye Contact: Immediately flush eyes with large quantities of water for at least 15
minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes,
then continue flushing eyes for at least 15 minutes. Obtain medical
attention without delay, preferably from an ophthalmologist. Suitable
emergency eye wash facility should be immediately available.
Skin Contact: Wash immediately and thoroughly with soap and flowing water. Remove
contaminated clothing while washing. Seek medical attention if irritation
persists. An MDI skin decontamination study demonstrated that cleaning
very soon after exposure is important, and that a polyglycol-based skin
cleanser or corn oil may be more effective than soap and water.
Ingestion: If swallowed, seek medical attention. Do not induce vomiting unless
directed to do so by medical personnel.
Notes to Physician: No specific antidote. Treatment of exposure should be directed at the
control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. Maintain
adequate ventilation and oxygenation of the patient. May cause
respiratory sensitization or asthma-like symptoms. Bronchodilators,
expectorants and antitussives may be of help. Treat bronchospasm with
inhaled beta2 agonist and oral or parenteral corticosteroids. Respiratory
symptoms, including pulmonary edema, may be delayed. Persons
receiving significant exposure should be observed 24-48 hours for signs
of respiratory distress. If you are sensitized to diisocyanates, consult
your physician regarding working with other respiratory irritants or
sensitizers. Cholinesterase inhibition has been noted in human exposure
but is not of benefit in determining exposure and is not correlated with
signs of exposure. Treatment of exposure should be directed at the
control of symptoms and the clinical condition of the patient. Excessive
exposure may aggravate preexisting asthma and other respiratory
disorders (e.g. emphysema, bronchitis, reactive airways dysfunction
syndrome).
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Flash Point: 230 C (446 F)
Flammable Properties: Product is not considered a fire hazard, but will burn if ignited.
NFPA Flammability Class: III B (Combustible liquid).
Suitable Extinguishing Media: Carbon dioxide, dry chemical, water fog or fine spray. Alcohol resistant
foams are preferred, general purpose synthetic foams or protein foams may function, but will not be
as effective.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: Do not use direct water stream, as it may spread fire.
Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards: Product reacts with water. Reaction may produce heat and/or
gases. This reaction may be violent. Container may rupture from gas generation in a fire situation.
Violent steam generation or eruption may occur upon application of direct water stream to hot liquids.
Dense smoke is produced when product burns.

9.2 Other Information: No data available
SECTION 10 - STABILITY AND REACTIVITY
Chemical Stability: Stable under recommended storage conditions (see Section 7).
Conditions to Avoid: Avoid temperatures above 450 deg F (230 deg C), potential violent decomposition may
occur. Avoid contact with water, as material reacts with water, releasing carbon dioxide which can cause
rapid pressure buildup and rupture of closed containers. Elevated temperatures accelerate this reaction.
Incompatible Materials: Strong acids, bases, or oxidizing agents. Avoid unintended contact with amines,
alcohols, water, moist air and metals such as aluminum, brass, copper, tin, zinc and galvanized metals.
Products of Combustion: Thermal decomposition in the presence of air may yield carbon monoxide, carbon
dioxide, phenolics, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, isocyanates, hydrogen cyanide and other unidentified toxic
and/or irritating compounds.
Hazardous polymerization will not occur.
SECTION 11 - TOXICOLOGY INFORMATION
Mixture Toxicity:
Inhalation Toxicity LC50: > 1mg/L
Component Toxicity Likely Routes of Exposure:
No data found
Target Organs:
May cause damage to the following organs:
Eyes Respiratory System
Effects of Overexposure:
Carcinogenicity: Rats have been exposed for their lifetime to respirable aerosol droplets of MDI/polymeric
MDI which resulted in chronic pulmonary irritation at high concentrations. Only at the top level (6 mg/m3),
there was a significant incidence of a benign tumor of the lung (adenoma) and one malignant tumor
(adenocarcinoma). There were no lung tumors at 1 mg/m3 and no effects at 0.2 mg/m3. Overall, the tumor
incidence, both benign and malignant, and the number of animals with the tumors were not different from
controls. The increased incidence of lung tumors is associated with prolonged respiratory irritation and the
concurrent accumulation of yellow material in the lung, which occurred throughout the study. Tumors
occurred concurrently with respiratory irritation and lung injury. In the absence of prolonged exposure to
high concentrations leading to chronic irritation and lung damage, it is highly unlikely that tumor formation

Component Toxicity Likely Routes of Exposure:
No data found
Target Organs:
May cause damage to the following organs:
Eyes Respiratory System
Effects of Overexposure:
Carcinogenicity: Rats have been exposed for their lifetime to respirable aerosol droplets of MDI/polymeric
MDI which resulted in chronic pulmonary irritation at high concentrations. Only at the top level (6 mg/m3),
there was a significant incidence of a benign tumor of the lung (adenoma) and one malignant tumor
(adenocarcinoma). There were no lung tumors at 1 mg/m3 and no effects at 0.2 mg/m3. Overall, the tumor
incidence, both benign and malignant, and the number of animals with the tumors were not different from
controls. The increased incidence of lung tumors is associated with prolonged respiratory irritation and the
concurrent accumulation of yellow material in the lung, which occurred throughout the study. Tumors
occurred concurrently with respiratory irritation and lung injury. In the absence of prolonged exposure to
high concentrations leading to chronic irritation and lung damage, it is highly unlikely that tumor formation |

Products of Combustion: Thermal decomposition in the presence of air may yield carbon monoxide,
carbon dioxide, phenolics, ammonia, nitrogen oxides and other unidentified toxic and/or irritating
compounds.
Fire Fighting: Stay upwind and keep people away. Isolate fire and deny unnecessary entry. Keep out
of low areas where gases (fumes) can accumulate. Water is not recommended, but may be applied in
large quantities as a fine spray when other extinguishing agents are not available. Use water spray to
cool fire-exposed containers and fire-affected zone until fire is out. Contain fire water run-off if
possible, as it may cause environmental damage. Review section 6 and section 12 of this SDS.
Protection of Firefighters: Wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) and
approved protective clothing (helmet, coat, trousers, boots and gloves). If contact is likely, use full
chemical resistant fire fighting clothing with SCBA.

Local exhaust ventilation may be necessary for some operations.
General Hygiene Considerations: Wash thoroughly after handling and before eating, drinking or
smoking.
Eye/face Protection: Use chemical safety glasses, splash-proof eye goggles or goggles with full
faceshield.
Skin Protection: Use nitrile or other impermeable chemical resistant gloves to prevent skin irritation. If
potential for skin contact is present, wear impervious, long-sleeved, body covering clothing and
rubber boots.
Respiratory Protection: Respiratory protection should not be needed. If exposure may or does exceed
occupational exposure limits, respiratory irritation is experienced, or during spray application, use a
properly fitted MSHA/NIOSH approved respirator fitted with organic vapor cartridges. In addition,
spray application may require the use of paint pre-filters. If the respirator is the sole means of
protection, use a full-face supplied air respirator. If sanding or grinding on cured material, use above
respirator fitted with HEPA filters or a dust mask.
Contaminated Gear: Remove contaminated clothing and shoes while washing. Wash clothing before
reuse. Discard items which cannot be decontaminated, including leather articles such as shoes, belts
and watchbands.

SECTION 11 - TOXICOLOGY INFORMATION
Mixture Toxicity:
Oral Toxicity LD50: 3,225mg/kg
Component Toxicity:
68479-98-1 Diethyltoluenediamine
Oral LD50: 485 mg/kg (Rat) Dermal LD50: 700 mg/kg (Rabbit)
Likely Routes of Exposure:
No data found
Target Organs:
May cause damage to the following organs:
Eyes Respiratory System
Effects of Overexposure:
Carcinogenicity: Titanium dioxide has been characterized by IARC as possibly carcinogenic to humans
(Group 2b) through inhalation (not ingestion), based on lifetime inhalation studies of rats. The IARC's
findings were consistent with the massive accumulation of fine dust particles in the rat's lung (which
overwhelm the natural lung clearance mechanisms, causing lung overloading) and consequential
pulmonary overload and inflammation that causes lung cancer. In further studies, these tumors were found
to occur only under particle overload conditions in a uniquely sensitive species, the rat, and have little or no
relevance for humans. Epidemiology studies on more than 20,000 workers do not suggest an increased risk
of cancer in humans from occupational exposure to titanium dioxide. If present in this product, the titanium
dioxide is in a "wet out" form and does not pose an inhalation hazard.
Carcinogenicity: This product may contain carbon black, a substance that has been listed by OSHA as a
carcinogen to humans when inhaled. If present in this product, it is pre-dispersed in a liquid and not

available as a dust. Under normal use conditions it would not be considered a hazard. IARC characterized
carbon black as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B) and concluded that there is sufficient evidence in
experimental animals for the carcinogenicity of inhaled carbon black dust and inadequate evidence of
carcinogenicity in humans. The IARC's findings were consistent with the massive accumulation of fine dust
particles in the lung which overwhelm the natural lung clearance mechanisms, known as "lung overload"
phenomenon, rather than from a specific chemical effect from the carbon black in the lung. NIOSH
recommends that only carbon blacks with a PAH level greater than 0.1% be considered potential
occupational carcinogens.
