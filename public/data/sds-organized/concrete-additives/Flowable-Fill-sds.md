Inhalation: If breathing becomes difficult, remove victim to fresh air. If necessary,
use artificial respiration to support vital functions. Seek medical
attention.
Ingestion: If product is swallowed, call physician or poison center if you feel unwell.
If professional advice is not available, do not induce vomiting. Never
induce vomiting or give dilutents (milk or water) to someone who is
unconscious, having convulsions, or who cannot swallow. Seek medical
advice. Take a copy of the label and/or SDS with the victim to the health
professional.
Medical Conditions
Generally Aggravated
By Exposure: Pre-existing skin, respiratory system or eye problems may be
aggravated by prolonged contact.
4.2 Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed: Exposure to skin and respiratory may cause
irritation. Contact with the eyes may cause burns. Contact with skin may
cause an allergic reaction. Repeated exposure may cause damage to
the lungs.
4.3 Recommendations to Physicians: Treat symptoms and eliminate overexposure.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1 Fire Extinguishing Materials:
Use the following fire extinguishing materials: Water Spray: Yes
Foam: Yes
Halon: Yes
Carbon Dioxide: Yes
Dry Chemical: Yes
Other: Any “C” Class
5.2 Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards:
Irritating and toxic fumes may be produced at high temperatures. Use of water may result if
the formation of a toxic aqueous solution. Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter
drains or water courses.
Explosive Sensitivity to Mechanical Impact: No
Explosive Sensitivity to Static Discharge: No
5.3 Special Fire-Fighting Procedures:
• Incipient fire responders should wear eye protection.
• Structural firefighters must wear Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) and full
protective equipment.
• Isolate materials not yet involved in the fire and protect personnel.
• Move containers from fire area if this can be done without risk; otherwise, cool with carefully
applied water spray.
