SECTION 3 - COMPOSITION / INFORMATION ON INGREDIENTS
Hazardous Ingredients WT% CAS No.
Hydrochloric Acid 15-35% 7647-01-0
Substance classified with a health or environmental hazard. Substance with a workplace exposure limit.
Synonyms: Hydrochloric Acid, Muriatic Acid, Hydrogen chloride.
SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
GENERAL
Move victim to fresh air. Call 911 or emergency medical service. Give artificial respiration if victim is
not breathing. Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; give
artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper
respiratory medical device. Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult. Remove and isolate
contaminated clothing and shoes. In case of contact with substance, immediately flush skin or eyes
with running water for at least 20 minutes. Keep victim warm and quiet. Effect of exposure
(inhalation, ingestion or skin contact) to substance may be delayed. Ensure that medical personnel
are aware of the material(s) involved and take precautions to protect themselves.
INHALATION
Move victim to fresh air. Call emergency medical care. Apply artificial respiration if victim is not
breathing. Do not use mouth-to-mouth method if victim ingested or inhaled the substance; induce
artificial respiration with the aid of a pocket mask equipped with a one-way valve or other proper
respiratory medical device. Administer oxygen if breathing is difficult.
EYE CONTACT
Irrigate copiously with clean fresh water for at least 10 minutes, holding the eyelids apart. Remove
contact lenses if present and easy to do - continue rinsing. Seek medical attention.
SKIN CONTACT
Remove contaminated clothing. Wash skin thoroughly with soap and water or use a recognized skin
cleanser. Get medical attention if irritation persists.

INGESTION
If accidently swallowed obtain IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. Keep at rest. Rinse mouth. Do
NOT induce vomiting.
Most important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed.
OVERVIEW
Effect of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or skin contact) to substance may be delayed.
Indication of immediate medical attention and special treatment needed.
Harmful if inhaled. May cause respiratory irritation. Causes serious eye damage. Causes severe skin
burns and eye damage. Harmful if swallowed.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Recommended Extinguishing Media: Regular dry chemical, carbon dioxide, fine water spray,
regular foam.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: High volume water jet.
Special Hazards Arising from the Substance or Mixture: Thermal decomposition releases toxic
and corrosive gas (Hydrogen chloride, Chlorine). Reacts with metal producing flammable/explosive
hydrogen gas. Heating can cause expansion or decomposition leading to violent rupture of
containers. Do not breathe mist/vapors/spray.
Advice for Firefighters: Wear positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). Wear
chemical protective clothing that is specifically recommended by the manufacturer. It may provide
little or no thermal protection. Structural firefighters’ protective clothing provides limited protection in
fire situations ONLY; it is not effective in spill situations where direct contact with the substance is
possible. Non-combustible, substance itself does not burn but may decompose upon heating to
produce corrosive and/or toxic fumes. Vapors may accumulate in confined areas (basement, tanks,
hopper/tank cars etc.). Substance may react with water (some violently), releasing corrosive and/or
toxic gases and runoff. Contact with metals may evolve flammable hydrogen gas. Containers may
explode when heated or if contaminated with water. Reaction with water may generate much heat
that will increase the concentration of fumes in the air. Fire will produce irritating, corrosive and/or
toxic gases. Runoff from fire control or dilution water may be corrosive and/or toxic and cause
pollution. Do not allow contaminated extinguishing water to enter the soil, groundwater or surface
waters. ERG Guide No. 157
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:
Evacuate all unprotected personnel and keep people away from and upwind of spill/leak. Put on
protective equipment (see Section 8). Avoid direct contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Do not
breathe vapor or fumes. Ensure adequate ventilation.
Environmental Precautions:
Do not allow spills to enter drains or watercourses.

Methods and Material for Containment and Cleaning Up:
CALL Emergency Response Telephone Number on Shipping Paper first. If Shipping Paper not
available or no answer, refer to appropriate telephone number in Section 1. Shut off the source of the
leak if conditions are safe. Neutralize with lime or soda ash or absorb with dry earth, sand or other
non-combustible material, and dispose waste appropriately. Wash area down with excess water to
remove residual material.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Precautions for Safe Handling:
Use protective equipment. Provide adequate ventilation. Do NOT add water to acid. Do not breathe
dust, vapor, mist, or gas. Do not get in eyes, on skin, or on clothing. Wash thoroughly after handling.
Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse.
Conditions for Safe Storage, Including any Incompatibilities:
Storage facilities must be properly designed and diked to contain any spillage. Store tightly closed in
a dry, cool and well-ventilated place. Protect containers from heat, physical damage, ignition sources
and incompatible materials.
SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
Exposure Control Parameters
CAS No. Material Source Value
OSHA Ceiling: 5 ppm (7mg/m3)
7647-01-0 Hydrochloric Acid ACGIH Ceiling: 2 ppm
NIOSH Ceiling: 5 ppm (7mg/m3)
Individual protection measures, such as personal protective equipment
RESPIRATORY
Use NIOSH/MSHA approved respirator, following manufacturer’s recommendations when
concentrations exceed permissible exposure limits.
EYES
Wear safety glasses with side shields to protect the eyes. An eye wash station is suggested as a
good workplace practice.
SKIN:
Chemical resistant clothing such as coveralls/apron boots should be worn. Chemical impervious
gloves. Emergency eyewash station should be in close proximity.
