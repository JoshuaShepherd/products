Autoignition Temperature: 485°C (905°F)
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES
In the event of a spill or accidental release, notify relevant authorities in accordance with all
applicable regulations. US regulations require reporting releases of this material to the
environment which exceed the applicable reportable quantity or oil spills which could reach any
waterway including intermittent dry creeks. The National Response Center can be reached at
(800)424-8802.
PROTECTIVE MEASURES
Avoid contact with spilled material. Warn or evacuate occupants in surrounding and downwind
areas if required due to toxicity or flammability of the material. See Section 5 for fire fighting
information. See the Hazard Identification Section for Significant Hazards. See Section 4 for First
Aid Advice. See Section 8 for advice on the minimum requirements for personal protective
equipment. Additional protective measures may be necessary, depending on the specific
circumstances and/or the expert judgment of the emergency responders.

Safety Data Sheet
Solvent 100
Version 1 pg. 5
For emergency responders: Respiratory protection: half-face or full-face respirator with filter(s) for
organic vapor and, when applicable, H2S, or Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) can be
used depending on the size of spill and potential level of exposure. If the exposure cannot be
completely characterized or an oxygen deficient atmosphere is possible or anticipated, SCBA is
recommended. Work gloves that are resistant to aromatic hydrocarbons are recommended. Note:
gloves made of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) are not water-resistant and are not suitable for
emergency use. Chemical goggles are recommended if splashes or contact with eyes is possible.
Small spills: normal antistatic work clothes are usually adequate. Large spills: full body suit of
chemical resistant, antistatic material is recommended.
SPILL MANAGEMENT
Land Spill: Eliminate all ignition sources (no smoking, flares, sparks or flames in immediate
area). Stop leak if you can do it without risk. All equipment used when handling the product must
be grounded. Do not touch or walk through spilled material. Prevent entry into waterways, sewer,
basements or confined areas. A vapor suppressing foam may be used to reduce vapors. Use
clean non-sparking tools to collect absorbed material. Absorb or cover with dry earth, sand or
other non-combustible material and transfer to containers. Large Spills: Water spray may reduce
vapor; but may not prevent ignition in closed spaces. Recover by pumping or with suitable
absorbent.
Water Spill: Stop leak if you can do it without risk. Eliminate sources of ignition. Warn other
shipping. If the Flash Point exceeds the Ambient Temperature by 10 degrees C or more, use
containment booms and remove from the surface by skimming or with suitable absorbents when
conditions permit. If the Flash Point does not exceed the Ambient Air Temperature by at least
10C, use booms as a barrier to protect shorelines and allow material to evaporate. Seek the
advice of a specialist before using dispersants.
Water spill and land spill recommendations are based on the most likely spill scenario for this
material; however, geographic conditions, wind, temperature, (and in the case of a water spill)
wave and current direction and speed may greatly influence the appropriate action to be taken.
For this reason, local experts should be consulted. Note: Local regulations may prescribe or limit
action to be taken.
ENVIRONMENTAL PRECAUTIONS
Large Spills: Dike far ahead of liquid spill for later recovery and disposal. Prevent entry into
waterways, sewers, basements or confined areas.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
HANDLING
Avoid breathing mists or vapors. Avoid all personal contact. Potentially toxic/irritating fumes/vapors
may be evolved from heated or agitated material. Use only with adequate ventilation. Do not enter
storage areas or confined spaces unless adequately ventilated. Prevent small spills and leakage to
avoid slip hazard. Material can accumulate static charges which may cause an electrical spark
(ignition source). Use proper bonding and/or ground procedures. However, bonding and grounds may
not eliminate the hazard from static accumulation. Consult local applicable standards for guidance.

Static Accumulator: This material is a static accumulator. A liquid is typically considered a
nonconductive, static accumulator if its conductivity is below 100 pS/m (100x10E-12 Siemens per
meter) and is considered a semiconductive, static accumulator if its conductivity is below 10,000
pS/m. Whether a liquid is nonconductive or semiconductive, the precautions are the same. A number
of factors, for example liquid temperature, presence of contaminants, anti-static additives and filtration
can greatly influence the conductivity of a liquid.
STORAGE
The container choice, for example storage vessel, may effect static accumulation and dissipation.
Keep container closed. Handle containers with care. Open slowly in order to control possible pressure
release. Store in a cool, well-ventilated area. Storage containers should be grounded and bonded.
Fixed storage containers, transfer containers and associated equipment should be grounded and
bonded to prevent accumulation of static charge.

XYLENES Creatinine in urine End of shift 1.5 g/g Methylhippuric acids ACGIH BELs (BEIs)
ENGINEERING CONTROLS
The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential exposure
conditions. Control measures to consider: Adequate ventilation should be provided so that exposure
limits are not exceeded. Use explosion-proof ventilation equipment.
PERSONAL PROTECTION
Personal protective equipment selections vary based on potential exposure conditions such as
applications, handling practices, concentration and ventilation. Information on the selection of
protective equipment for use with this material, as provided below, is based upon intended, normal
usage.
Respiratory Protection: If engineering controls do not maintain airborne contaminant concentrations
at a level which is adequate to protect worker health, an approved respirator may be appropriate.
Respirator selection, use, and maintenance must be in accordance with regulatory requirements, if
applicable. Types of respirators to be considered for this material include:
Half-face filter respirator
For high airborne concentrations, use an approved supplied-air respirator, operated in positive
pressure mode. Supplied air respirators with an escape bottle may be appropriate when oxygen
levels are inadequate, gas/vapor warning properties are poor, or if air purifying filter capacity/rating
may be exceeded.
Hand Protection: Any specific glove information provided is based on published literature and glove
manufacturer data. Glove suitability and breakthrough time will differ depending on the specific use
conditions. Contact the glove manufacturer for specific advice on glove selection and breakthrough
times for your use conditions. Inspect and replace worn or damaged gloves. The types of gloves to be
considered for this material include:
Chemical resistant gloves are recommended.
Eye Protection: If contact is likely, safety glasses with side shields are recommended.
Skin and Body Protection: Any specific clothing information provided is based on published literature
or manufacturer data. The types of clothing to be considered for this material include:
Chemical/oil resistant clothing is recommended.
Specific Hygiene Measures: Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing
after handling the material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash work clothing
and protective equipment to remove contaminants. Discard contaminated clothing and footwear that
cannot be cleaned. Practice good housekeeping.
