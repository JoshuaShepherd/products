Engineering measures:
The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential
exposure conditions. Select controls based on a risk assessment of local circumstances.
Appropriate measures include:
Use sealed systems as far as possible.
Adequate explosion-proof ventilation to control airborne con-centrations below the exposure
guidelines/limits.
Local exhaust ventilation is recommended.
Eye washes and showers for emergency use.
Firewater monitors and deluge systems are recommended.
Where material is heated, sprayed or mist formed, there is greater potential for airborne
concentrations to be generated.
General Information:
Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing hands after handling the
material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash work clothing and protective
equipment to remove contaminants. Discard con-taminated clothing and footwear that cannot be
cleaned. Practice good housekeeping.
Define procedures for safe handling and maintenance of controls.
Educate and train workers in the hazards and control measures relevant to normal activities
associated with this product.
Ensure appropriate selection, testing and maintenance of equipment used to control exposure,
e.g. personal protective equipment, local exhaust ventilation.
Drain down system prior to equipment break-in or mainte-nance.
Retain drain downs in sealed storage pending disposal or subsequent recycle.
Personal protective equipment
Respiratory protection:
If engineering controls do not maintain airborne concentra-tions to a level which is adequate to
protect worker health, select respiratory protection equipment suitable for the spe-cific conditions
of use and meeting relevant legislation.
Check with respiratory protective equipment suppliers.
Where air-filtering respirators are unsuitable (e.g. airborne concentrations are high, risk of oxygen
deficiency, confined space) use appropriate positive pressure breathing appa-ratus.
Where air-filtering respirators are suitable, select an appro-priate combination of mask and filter.
If air-filtering respirators are suitable for conditions of use:
Select a filter suitable for organic gases and vapours [Type AX boiling point ≤65°C (149°F)].

Engineering measures:
The level of protection and types of controls necessary will vary depending upon potential
exposure conditions. Select controls based on a risk assessment of local circumstances.
Appropriate measures include:
Use sealed systems as far as possible.
Adequate explosion-proof ventilation to control airborne con-centrations below the exposure
guidelines/limits.
Local exhaust ventilation is recommended.
Eye washes and showers for emergency use.
Firewater monitors and deluge systems are recommended.
Where material is heated, sprayed or mist formed, there is greater potential for airborne
concentrations to be generated.
General Information:
Always observe good personal hygiene measures, such as washing hands after handling the
material and before eating, drinking, and/or smoking. Routinely wash work clothing and protective
equipment to remove contaminants. Discard con-taminated clothing and footwear that cannot be
cleaned. Practice good housekeeping.
Define procedures for safe handling and maintenance of controls.
Educate and train workers in the hazards and control measures relevant to normal activities
associated with this product.
Ensure appropriate selection, testing and maintenance of equipment used to control exposure,
e.g. personal protective equipment, local exhaust ventilation.
Drain down system prior to equipment break-in or mainte-nance.
Retain drain downs in sealed storage pending disposal or subsequent recycle.
Personal protective equipment
Respiratory protection:
If engineering controls do not maintain airborne concentra-tions to a level which is adequate to
protect worker health, select respiratory protection equipment suitable for the spe-cific conditions
of use and meeting relevant legislation.
Check with respiratory protective equipment suppliers.
Where air-filtering respirators are unsuitable (e.g. airborne concentrations are high, risk of oxygen
deficiency, confined space) use appropriate positive pressure breathing appa-ratus.
Where air-filtering respirators are suitable, select an appro-priate combination of mask and filter.
If air-filtering respirators are suitable for conditions of use:
Select a filter suitable for organic gases and vapours [Type AX boiling point ≤65°C (149°F)]. |

Safety Data Sheet

Version 1
Respirator selection, use and maintenance should be in ac-cordance with the requirements of the
OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard, 29 CFR 1910.134.
Hand protection Remarks:
Where hand contact with the product may occur the use of gloves approved to relevant standards
(e.g. Europe: EN374, US: F739) made from the following materials may provide suitable chemical
protection. Longer term protection: Nitrile rubber gloves. Incidental contact/Splash protection: PVC
or neoprene rubber gloves For continuous contact we recom-mend gloves with breakthrough time
of more than 240 minutes with preference for > 480 minutes where suitable gloves can be
identified. For short-term/splash protection we recommend the same, but recognize that suitable
gloves offering this level of protection may not be available and in this case a lower breakthrough
time maybe acceptable so long as appropriate maintenance and replacement regimes are
followed. Glove thickness is not a good predictor of glove resistance to a chemical as it is
dependent on the exact composition of the glove material. Glove thickness should be typically
greater than 0.35 mm depending on the glove make and model. Suitability and durability of a glove
is dependent on usage, e.g. frequency and duration of contact, chemical resistance of glove
material, dexterity. Always seek advice from glove suppliers. Contaminated gloves should be re-
placed. Personal hygiene is a key element of effective hand care. Gloves must only be worn on
clean hands. After using gloves, hands should be washed and dried thoroughly. Appli-cation of a
non-perfumed moisturizer is recommended.
Eye protection:
Wear goggles for use against liquids and gas.
Wear full face shield if splashes are likely to occur.
Skin and body protection:
Wear chemical resistant gloves/gauntlets and boots. Where risk of splashing, also wear an apron.
Protective measures:
Personal protective equipment (PPE) should meet recom-mended national standards. Check with
PPE suppliers.
Hygiene measures:
Wash hands before eating, drinking, smoking and using the toilet.
Launder contaminated clothing before re-use.
Environmental exposure controls
General advice:
Local guidelines on emission limits for volatile substances must be observed for the discharge of
exhaust air containing vapour. Minimise release to the environment. An environmental as-
sessment must be made to ensure compliance with local envi-ronmental legislation. Information on
accidental release measures are to be found in section 6.
