Safety Data Sheet
All Shield WB
Version 1
Ingestion: If swallowed seek medical attention immediately and show the doctor packing or
label. Do not induce vomiting unless directed to do so by medical personnel. Do
not give anything to an unconscious or convulsing person.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Fire and Explosion Hazard: The product itself will flash but not sustain combustion.
Hydrolyzes on contact with moisture releasing ignitable vapors.
Hazardous decomposition products formed under fire conditions.
Hazardous combustion products: Hydrogen fluoride,
formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, silicon dioxide, nitrogen oxides,
carbon monoxide and other hazardous decomposition products
may be formed.
Fire Extinguishing Media Use alcohol-resistant foam, dry chemical, carbon dioxide, or
water in large amounts for surrounding fire.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: None known
Specific Hazards in Case of Fire: Combustion can produce oxides of carbon, nitrogen, silicone and
slight race of formaldehyde or hydrogen fluoride.
Thermal Decomposition: To avoid thermal decomposition, do not overheat. Thermal
decomposition can lead to release of irritating gases and vapors.
Special Fire Fighting Information: Evacuate personnel to safe areas. Wear self-contained breathing
apparatus and appropriate full protective equipment. Move
containers from area of the fire if this can be done without risk.
Cool fire-exposed containers with water. Do not allow run-off
from fire-fighting to enter drains or water courses.
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
Personal Precautions: Evacuate personnel to safe area. Ensure cleanup is done only
by trained personnel. Material can create slippery conditions.
Avoid contact with eyes and skin. Avoid inhaling mists and
vapors.
Protective Equipment: Wear personal protective equipment. Ventilate area and exhaust
vapors.
Environmental Precautions: Do not discharge to streams, ponds, lakes or sewers. Avoid
subsoil penetration.

Version 1
Containment and Cleaning up: Soak up with sawdust, sand, oil dry or other absorbent material.
Pick up and transfer to properly labelled containers. Do not flush
away with water.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Handling Conditions: Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing. Do not breathe
vapors, mist or gas. Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Do
not spray near open flame or heated surface. **Agitate
thoroughly before use** Avoid formation of aerosols.
Storage Conditions: Keep container tightly closed in a dry, cool and well-ventilated
place with temperatures 0Â°C - 40Â°C. Keep away from heat,
and sunlight. *** WARNING - PROTECT FROM FREEZING*** In
the cold months, a freeze indicator is attached to this shipment
(one indicator per pallet). If the bulb on the indicator is not clear,
this shipment was exposed to temperatures below 32Â°F
(0Â°C). Perishable if frozen. If product is exposed, product
quality testing should be performed before accepting the
shipment.
SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
Exposure Limits: None established
Appropriate Engineering
Controls: Adequate ventilation must be used during application. Use
suitable local exhaust to remove musts or vapors during spray or
other applications
Personal protective equipment:
Respiratory Protection: Wear respirator where spraying or vaporizing occurs. A NIOSH
approved air purifying respirator is recommended if
overexposure to dusts, mists, or vapors could occur.
Hand Protection: Wear protective gloves.
Eye Protection: Wear safety glasses with side shields or goggles.
Skin and Body Protection: Rubber apron, boots or coveralls as necessary to prevent skin
contact.
Hygiene Measures: An eyewash and safety shower should be nearby and ready for
use.
