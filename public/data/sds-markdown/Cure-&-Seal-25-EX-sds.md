below guidelines listed above, if applicable. If
necessary, use only respiratory protection
authorized in the U.S. Federal OSHA
Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR
1910.134), equivalent U.S. State standards,
Canadian CSA Standard Z94.4-93, the
European Standard EN149, or EU member
states.
Eye Protection: Safety glasses or goggles are required.
If necessary, refer to U.S. OSHA 29 CFR
1910.133, Canadian Standards, and the
European Standard EN166, Australian
Standards, or relevant Japanese Standards.
Hand Protection: Chemical resistant gloves are required to
prevent skin contact.
If necessary, refer to U.S. OSHA 29 CFR
1910.138, the European Standard DIN EN 374,
the appropriate Standards of Canada, Australian
Standards, or relevant Japanese Standards.
Body Protection: Use body protect appropriate to task being
performed.
If necessary, refer to appropriate Standards of
Canada, or appropriate standards of the EU,
Australian Standards, or relevant Japanese
Standards. If a hazard of injury to the feet exists
due to falling objects, rolling objects, where
objects may pierce the soles of the feet or where
employee’s feet may be exposed to electrical
hazards, use foot protection, as described in
U.S. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.136. |
