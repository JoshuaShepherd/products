Version 1
SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
4.1 Description of First Aid Measures:
Eye Contact: In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at
least 15 minutes, including under lids. If easy to do, remove contact
lenses, if worn. Call a physician if irritation develops or persists.
Skin Contact: In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water. A burn
from molten material should be treated as a thermal burn. Cool as soon
as possible. Get medical attention if symptoms occur.
Inhalation: If inhaled, remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give artificial respiration.
If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Get medical advice/attention.
Ingestion: If swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by
medical personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious
person. Get medical advice/attention.
4.2 Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed:
Eye Contact: May cause eye irritation. Symptoms may include discomfort or pain,
excess blinking and tear production, with possible redness and swelling.
Skin Contact: In May cause skin irritation. Symptoms may include redness, drying,
defatting and cracking of the skin. Molten material may cause burns.
Inhalation: May cause respiratory tract irritation.
Ingestion: May cause stomach distress, nausea or vomiting.
4.3 Recommendations to Physicians: Symptoms may not appear immediately. In case of accident
or if you feel unwell, seek medical advice immediately (show the label or SDS where possible).
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1 Fire Extinguishing Materials:
Suitable Extinguishing Media: Water fog, foam, dry chemical, and carbon dioxide.
Unsuitable Extinguishing Media: None known.
5.2 Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards:
Products of Combustion: May include, and are not limited to: oxides of carbon.
5.3 Special Fire-Fighting Procedures:
Keep upwind of fire. Wear full fire fighting turn-out gear (full Bunker gear) and respiratory protection
(SCBA). Static charges may be generated by emptying packages. Use water spray to keep fire
exposed containers cool. Combustion may generate hazardous fumes. Avoid breathing smoke &
fumes. Dust in the atmosphere and on surfaces may present a dust explosion hazard (for more
information refer to OSHA Bulletin Combustible Dust in Industry: Preventing and Mitigating the
Effects of Fire and Explosion and NFPA 654: Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Dust
Explosions from the Manufacturing, Processing, and Handling of Combustible Particulate Solids).

SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
6.1 Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:
Use personal protection recommended in Section 8. Keep unnecessary personnel away from the
release. Avoid any contact with the skin and eyes. Eliminate sources of ignition. Dust deposits
should not be allowed to accumulate on surfaces, as these may form an explosive mixture if they
are released into the atmosphere in sufficient concentration. Avoid dispersal of dust in the air (i.e.,
clearing dust surfaces with compressed air).
6.2 Environmental Precautions:
Construct a dike to prevent spreading. Keep out of sewers, storm drains, surface waters, and soils.
6.3 Spill and Leak Response:
Methods for Containment: Confine the spill at the source. Contain spill, then place in a suitable
container. Do not flush to sewer or allow to enter waterways. Use appropriate Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE).
Methods for Cleaning-Up: Sweep up material, avoid generating dust. If material is molten,
attempt to confine the spill until the cooling material solidifies, then scrape up and dispose of properly.
Keep spills and cleaning runoff out of municipal sewers and open bodies of water.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions for Safe Handling:
Handling: Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Fine powder/dust may cause skin, eye, or respiratory
irritation. Use with adequate ventilation. Static charges may be generated when emptying containers.
Use product with caution around heat, sparks, static electricity and open flame. Avoid excessive
temperatures, freezing conditions, and sources of ignition. Avoid humidity and moisture. Do not
contaminate product. Avoid breathing dusts. (See section 8)
General Hygiene Advice: Launder contaminated clothing before reuse. Wash hands before
eating, drinking, or smoking.
7.2 Storage and Handling Practices:
Keep out of the reach of children. Keep container tightly closed and in a dry, well-ventilated place.
Keep cool [0 - 50 °C (32 - 122 °F)]. (See section 10)
SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
8.1 Exposure Parameters:
Ingredients OSHA PEL ACGIH-TLV

Safety Data Sheet
Surface Grip
Version 1
Engineering Controls: Use ventilation adequate to keep exposures (airborne levels of dust,
fume, vapor, etc.) below recommended exposure limits. It is recommended that all dust control
equipment such as local exhaust ventilation and material transport systems involved in handling of
this product contain explosion relief vents or an explosion suppression system or an oxygen-deficient
environment. Ensure that dust-handling systems (such as exhaust ducts, dust collectors, vessels, and
processing equipment) are designed in a manner to prevent the escape of dust into the work area
(i.e., there is not leakage from the equipment).
8.3 Individual Protective Measures
Personal Protective Equipment:
Eye/Face Protection: Wear ANSI approved (Z87.1) safety glasses with side
shield, or goggles. Wear safety glasses and face shield
when working with molten material.
Skin Protection:
Hand Protection: Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves.
Body Protection: Wear suitable protective clothing.
Respiratory Protection: Wear a NIOSH/MSHA approved dust mask or respirator
if airborne concentrations are not maintained below the

General Health and Safety
Measures: Do not eat, smoke or drink where material is handled,
processed or stored. Wash hands carefully before eating
or smoking. Provide general and/or local exhaust
ventilation to control airborne levels below the exposure
