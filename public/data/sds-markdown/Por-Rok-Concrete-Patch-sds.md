SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
4.1 Description of First Aid Measures:
Eye Contact: In case of contact, immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at
least 15 minutes. If easy to do, remove contact lenses, if worn. Get
medical attention immediately.
Skin Contact: In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water. Remove
contaminated clothing and shoes. Wash clothing before reuse. Call a
physician if irritation develops and persists.
Inhalation: If breathing is difficult, remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a
position comfortable for breathing. Give oxygen if breathing is difficult.
Give artificial respiration if not breathing. Get medical advice/attention if
you feel unwell.
Ingestion: If swallowed, do NOT induce vomiting unless directed to do so by
medical personnel. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious
person. Give 2 cupfuls of water if victim is conscience and alert. Get
medical advice/attention.
4.2 Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed:
Eye Contact: Causes serious eye damage. Symptoms may include discomfort or pain,
excess blinking and tear production, with marked redness and swelling
of the conjunctiva. May cause burns in the presence of moisture.
Skin Contact: Causes skin irritation. May cause burns in the presence of moisture.
Skin contact during hydration may slowly develop sufficient heat that
may cause severe burns possibly resulting in permanent injury. Do not
allow product to harden around any body part or allow continuous,
prolonged contact with skin. Handling can cause dry skin. May cause
sensitization by skin contact.
Inhalation: May cause respiratory tract irritation. May cause burns in the presence
of moisture.
Ingestion: May be harmful if swallowed. May cause stomach distress, nausea or
vomiting.
