Remove all sources of ignition. Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking.
Use only non-sparking tools. Soak up with sawdust, sand, oil dry or other inert absorbent material.
Pick up and transfer to properly labelled containers.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions for Safe Handling:
Do not use sparking tools. Ground containers when transferring material. Avoid formation of
respirable particles. Do not breathe vapours or spray mist. Avoid contact with skin, eyes and clothing.
Wash hands thoroughly after handling. Wash contaminated clothing before re-use. ***Agitate
thoroughly before use***
7.2 Storage and Handling Practices:
Store in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Store in a well-ventilated place. Store locked up. Keep
container tightly closed. Keep away from heat sparks and open flame. Store away from incompatible
materials. If the product freezes, allow the product to thaw then mix thoroughly. Product quality
testing should be performed before using.
7.3 Specific Uses:
These products should be used only by trained personnel. Do not under any circumstances
aerosolize these products.
These products should only be dispensed by airless sprayers less than 50 psi with a particle size
production of greater than 15 microns or a coarse spray device such as a trigger sprayer. Avoid
breathing vapor or spray mist. Never use a paint sprayer to apply these products. Power paint
sprayers generate very high pressures, aerosolize the product and create significant combustion
hazards. A respirator must be used when spraying these products and the products should only be
used in areas with proper ventilation. Avoid contact with eyes or skin. Glasses or goggles, gloves
and other protective clothing should always be worn when the product is used. Avoid contamination
of tobacco products. Wash hands thoroughly before smoking.
Use the proper equipment. This includes:
 Exhaust fan
 Low pressure airless sprayer (less than 50 psi)
 Respirator with organic vapor cartridge
 Glasses or goggles, gloves and protective clothing
Before you start spraying:
 Set up cross ventilation, open doors and windows, place a fan blowing out of a window or
door to increase exhaust
 Remove all people and animals from the exposure area
 All personnel in the exposure area wear a proper fitting respirator with organic vapor
cartridge
 Turn off air conditioning or heating units and remove all ignition sources
 Use low pressure airless sprayer (less than 50 psi)

When spraying solvent-based systems, solvent will continue to evaporate after the product has
been applied, so you must do the following until the solvent vapor concentration is below 300
ppm (about 60 minutes):
 Continue cross ventilation o Keep people and animals out of the spray area
 Continue to wear respirators in the spray area
 Do not expose the treated fabric to open flame or other ignition sources (such as,
matches, or cigarette lighters)
After the product dries, only the soil and stain repellent is left behind on the treated substrate. It
is safe, nonhazardous and hypoallergenic. The treated substrate will be dry to the touch after 30-
60 minutes and is completely dried and ready for use within 24 hours.
