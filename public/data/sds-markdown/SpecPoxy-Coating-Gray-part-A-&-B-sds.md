Use cautious judgment when cleaning up spill. Wear suitable protective clothing, gloves, and eye/face
protection.
6.2 Environmental Precautions:
Construct a dike to prevent spreading. Keep out of sewers, storm drains, surface waters, and soils.
6.3 Spill and Leak Response:
Small Spills:
 Collect material via broom or mop. Place in tightly sealed containers for proper disposal.
 Approach spill areas with caution.
 If liquid was introduced, create a dike or trench to contain material.
 Soak up with absorbent material such as clay, sand or other suitable non-reactive material.
Large Spills:
 Place in leak-proof containers. Seal tightly for proper disposal.
 Dispose of in accordance with U.S. Federal, State, and local hazardous waste disposal
regulations and those of Canada and its Provinces, those of Australia, Japan and EU
Member States (see Section 13, Disposal Considerations).
