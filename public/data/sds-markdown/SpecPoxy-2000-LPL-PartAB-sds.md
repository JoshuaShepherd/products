Safety Data Sheet
SpecPoxy 2000 LPL Part B
Version 1 pg. 14
Environmental Precautions: Avoid runoff into storm sewers, ditches, and waterways.
Methods for containment: Contain spills with an inert absorbent material such as soil or
sand. Prevent from spreading by covering, diking or other means. Provide ventilation.
Methods for clean up: Clean up spills immediately observing precautions in the
protective equipment section. Place into a suitable container for disposal. Provide ventilation. After
removal, flush spill area with soap and water to remove trace residue.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
Handling:
Use with adequate ventilation. Avoid breathing vapor and contact with eyes, skin and clothing.
Storage:
Store in a cool, dry, well ventilated area away from sources of heat, combustible materials, and
incompatible substances. Keep container tightly closed when not in use.
Hygiene Practices:
Wash thoroughly after handling. Avoid contact with eyes and skin. Avoid inhaling vapor or mist.
SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION
Engineering Controls: Use appropriate engineering control such as process enclosures, local
exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls to control airborne levels below recommended
exposure limits. Good general ventilation should be sufficient to control airborne levels. Where such
systems are not effective wear suitable personal protective equipment, which performs satisfactorily
and meets OSHA or other recognized standards. Consult with local procedures for selection, training,
inspections and maintenance of the personal protective equipment.
Eye/Face Protection: Wear protective glasses or splash goggles as describe by 29 CFR 1910.133,
OSHA eye and face protection regulation, or the European standard EN 166.
Skin Protection Description: Chemical-resistant gloves and chemical goggles, face-shield and
synthetic apron or coveralls should be used to prevent contact with eyes, skin or clothing.
Respiratory Protection: A NIOSH approved air-purifying respirator with an organic vapor cartridge
or canister may be permissible under certain circumstances where airborne concentrations are
expected to exceed exposure limits. Protection provided by air purifying respirators is limited. Use a
positive pressure air supplied respirator if there is any potential for an uncontrolled release, exposure
levels are not known, or any other circumstances where air purifying respirators may not provide
adequate protection.
Other protective: Facilities storing or utilizing the material should be equipped with an eyewash
facility and safety shower.
