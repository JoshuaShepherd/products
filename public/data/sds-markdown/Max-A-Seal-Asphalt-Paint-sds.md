Safety Data Sheet
according to Federal Register / Vol. 77, No. 58 / Monday, March 26, 2012 / Rules and Regulations
SECTION 7: Handling and storage
7.1. Precautions for safe handling
Precautions for safe handling : Wash hands and other exposed areas with mild soap and water before eating, drinking or
smoking and when leaving work. Provide good ventilation in process area to prevent formation
of vapor. Avoid breathing vapors. Obtain special instructions before use. Do not handle until all
safety precautions have been read and understood.
Hygiene measures : Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the workplace. Wash contaminated
clothing before reuse.
7.2. Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities
Technical measures : Proper grounding procedures to avoid static electricity should be followed. Ground/bond
container and receiving equipment. Use explosion-proof equipment.
Storage conditions : Keep only in the original container in a cool, well ventilated place away from oxidizers,
excessive heat, and open flame. Keep container closed when not in use. Do not freeze.
Incompatible products : Strong bases. Strong acids.
Incompatible materials : Sources of ignition. Direct sunlight.

8.2. Exposure controls
Appropriate engineering controls : Ensure that proper ventilation is provided to maintain exposures below regulated limits.
Personal protective equipment : Avoid all unnecessary exposure. At a minimum wear long sleeved cotton shirt buttoned at the
collar and full length cotton pants. Synthetic fibers can melt and adhere to the skin when heated.
Do not fold back or roll up cuffs.
Hand protection : Wear protective gloves that protect against thermal burns when handling hot material.
Eye protection : Chemical goggles or safety glasses.
Respiratory protection : Not typically required. In cases where exposures exceed occupational control limits, a NIOSH
approved respirator is recommended.
