information required by the CPR, EU Directives and the Japanese Industrial Standard JIS Z 7250:2000
SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
4.1 Description of First Aid Measures:
Eye contact : Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water, occasionally lifting the upper and
lower eyelids. Check for and remove any contact lenses. Continue to rinse for at
least 10 minutes. Get medical attention.
Inhalation : Remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for
breathing. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest occurs,
provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel. It may be dangerous
to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Get medical
attention if adverse health effects persist or are severe. If unconscious, place in
recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain an open
airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband.
Skin contact : Wash skin thoroughly with soap and water or use recognized skin cleanser.
Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Get medical attention if symptoms
occur. Wash clothing before reuse. Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.
Ingestion : Get medical attention immediately. Call a poison center or physician. Wash out
mouth with water. Remove dentures if any. Remove victim to fresh air and keep
at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If material has been swallowed
and the exposed person is conscious, give small quantities of water to drink.
Stop if the exposed person feels sick as vomiting may be dangerous. Aspiration
hazard if swallowed. Can enter lungs and cause damage. Do not induce
vomiting. If vomiting occurs, the head should be kept low so that vomit does not
enter the lungs. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. If

4.2 Most important symptoms/effects, acute and delayed
Aside from the information found under Description of first aid measures (above) and Indication of
immediate medical attention and special treatment needed (below), any additional important
symptoms and effects are described in Section 11: Toxicology Information.
4.3 Indication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed
Notes to physician: If burn is present, treat as any thermal burn, after decontamination. No specific
antidote. Treatment of exposure should be directed at the control of symptoms and the clinical
condition of the patient.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
Fire Extinguishing Materials:
Suitable extinguishing media: Use dry chemical, CO , water spray (fog) or foam.
Unsuitable extinguishing media: Do not use water jet.
Specific hazards arising from the chemical: Standard pr₂ocedure for chemical fires.
Advice for firefighters: Water used to extinguish fire should not enter drainage systems,
soil or stretches of water.
Ensure there are sufficient retaining facilities for water used to
extinguish fire.
Fire residues and contaminated fire extinguishing water must be
disposed of in accordance with local regulations.
As in any fire, wear self-contained positive-pressure breathing
apparatus, (MSHA/NIOSH approved or equivalent) and full
protective gear.
SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
Personal precautions, protective equipment and emergency procedures:
Remove all sources of ignition. Use personal protective equipment. Follow safe handling advice and
personal protective equipment recommendations.
Environmental Precautions:
Do not release the product to the aquatic environment above defined regulatory levels. Prevent
further leakage or spillage if safe to do so. Prevent spreading over a wide area (e.g. by containment
or oil barriers). Retain and dispose of contaminated wash water. Local authorities should be advised if
significant spillages cannot be contained.
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up:
Non-sparking tools should be used. Soak up with inert absorbent material. Suppress (knock down)
gases/vapours/mists with a water spray jet. Clean up remaining materials from spill with suitable
absorbant. Local or national regulations may apply to releases and disposal of this material, as well
as those materials and items employed in the cleanup of releases. You will need to determine which
regulations are applicable. For large spills, provide dyking or other appropriate containment to keep
