8.2. Exposure controls
Appropriate engineering controls : Ensure that proper ventilation is provided to maintain exposures below regulated limits.
Personal protective equipment : Avoid all unnecessary exposure. At a minimum wear long-sleeved cotton shirt buttoned at the
collar and full-length pants. Synthetic fibers can melt and adhere to the skin when heated. Do
not fold back or roll up cuffs.
Hand protection : Wear protective gloves that protect against thermal burns when handling hot material.
Eye protection : Chemical goggles or safety glasses.
Respiratory protection : Not typically required. In cases where exposures exceed occupational control limits a NIOSH
approved respirator is recommended. Wear appropriate mask.
Other information : Do not eat, drink or smoke during use. Wash hands and other exposed areas after use.
