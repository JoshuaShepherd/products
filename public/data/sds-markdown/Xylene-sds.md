INTRAPERITONEAL (LD50), Acute: 2,624 mg/kg [Rat].
Effects from Prolonged or Repeated Exposure:
Findings from a 2-year inhalation study in rodents conducted by NTP were as
follows: Effects were observed only at the highest exposure level (750 ppm). At
this level the incidence of renal tumors was elevated in male rats (tubular
carcinomas) and female rats (tubular adenomas). Also, the incidence of tumors
was elevated in male mice (alveolar and bronchiolar carcinomas) and female
mice (hepatocellular carcinomas). IARC has classified ethyl benzene as
“possibly carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2B). Studies in laboratory animals
indicate some evidence of post-implantation deaths following high levels of
maternal exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at
this time. Studies in laboratory animals indicate limited evidence of renal
malformations, resorptions, and developmental delays following high levels of
maternal exposure. The relevance of these findings to humans is not clear at
this time. Studies in laboratory animals indicate some evidence of adverse
effects on the liver, kidney, thyroid, and pituitary gland.
