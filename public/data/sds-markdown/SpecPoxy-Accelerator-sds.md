SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES
4.1 Description of First Aid Measures:
Eye Contact: If product enters the eyes, flush with plenty of water or eye wash
solution for several minutes. Remove contacts if present and easy to
do. Seek medical attention if irritation persists.
Skin Contact: Wash skin thoroughly with soap and water after handling. Seek medical
attention if irritation develops and persists.
Inhalation: If breathing becomes difficult, remove victim to fresh air. If necessary,
use artificial respiration to support vital functions. Seek medical
attention.
Ingestion: If product is swallowed, call physician or poison center immediately. If
professional advice is not available, do not induce vomiting. Never
induce vomiting or give diluents (milk or water) to someone who is
unconscious, having convulsions, or who cannot swallow. Seek medical
advice. Take a copy of the label and/or SDS with the victim to the health
professional.
Medical Conditions
Generally Aggravated
By Exposure: Pre-existing skin, respiratory system or eye problems may be
aggravated by prolonged contact.
4.2 Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed: Exposure to skin and eyes may cause burns
or redness.
4.3 Recommendations to Physicians: Treat symptoms and eliminate overexposure.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1 Fire Extinguishing Materials:
Use the following fire extinguishing materials: Use water spray, alcohol resistant foam, BC-
powder, Carbon dioxide
Unsuitable extinguishing media: Water Jet
5.2 Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards:
Irritating and toxic fumes may be produced at high temperatures. Use of water may result if
the formation of a toxic aqueous solution. Do not allow run-off from firefighting to enter drains
or water courses.
5.3 Special Fire-Fighting Procedures:
• Incipient fire responders should wear eye protection.
• Structural firefighters must wear Self-Contained Breathing
• Apparatus (SCBA) and full protective equipment.
• Isolate materials not yet involved in the fire and protect personnel.
• Move containers from fire area if this can be done without risk; otherwise, cool with carefully
applied water spray.
