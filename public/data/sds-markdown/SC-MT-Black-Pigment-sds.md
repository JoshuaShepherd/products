Version 1 pg. 2
4.2 Symptoms and Effects Both Acute and Delayed: Dust contact with the eyes can lead to
mechanical irritation. Inhalation of dust may cause shortness of breath,
tightness of the chest, a sore throat and cough. The product is not
irritant but as with all fine powders can absorb moisture and natural oils
from the surface of the skin during prolonged exposure. Individuals with
sensitive skin may experience skin drying on prolonged or repeated
exposure.
4.3 Recommendations to Physicians: Treat symptomatically.
SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES
5.1 Fire Extinguishing Materials:
Use the following fire extinguishing materials: Water Spray: Yes
Foam: Yes
0
Carbon Dioxide: Yes
Dry Chemical: Yes
Other: Any “C” Class
5.2 Unusual Fire and Explosion Hazards:
Specific hazards during firefighting: It may not be obvious that carbon black is burning
unless the material is stirred and sparks are apparent.
Carbon black that has been on fire should be
observed closely for at least 48 hours to ensure no
smoldering material is present. Burning produces
irritant fumes. The product is insoluble and floats on
water. If possible, try to contain floating material. This
material creates a fire hazard because it floats on
water. May ignite other combustible materials.
Hazardous combustion products: Carbon dioxide (CO2)
Carbon monoxide
Sulphur oxides
Specific extinguishing methods: Use extinguishing measures that are appropriate to
local circumstances and the surrounding environment.
Further information: Standard procedure for chemical fires
5.3 Special Fire-Fighting Procedures:
• In the event of fire, wear self-contained breathing apparatus.

SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES (STEPS FOR SPILLS)
6.1 Personal Precautions, Protective Equipment and Emergency Procedures:
Use personal protective equipment. Ensure adequate ventilation. Avoid dust formation. Remove all
sources of ignition. Never return spills in original containers for re-use. Treat recovered material as
described in the section "Disposal considerations". For disposal considerations see section 13.
6.2 Environmental Precautions:
No special environmental precautions required. Local authorities should be advised if significant
spillages cannot be contained.
SECTION 7 - HANDLING AND STORAGE
7.1 Precautions for Safe Handling:
Minimize dust generation and accumulation. Avoid formation of respirable particles. Avoid inhalation,
ingestion and contact with skin and eyes. Avoid exposure - obtain special instructions before use. For
personal protection see section 8. Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited in the
application area. Provide sufficient air exchange and/or exhaust in work rooms. Dispose of rinse
water in accordance with local and national regulations.
7.2 Storage and Handling Practices:
Keep away from fire, sparks, and heated surfaces. Keep in container tightly closed in a dry and well-
ventilated place. Observe label precautions. Electrical installations / working materials must comply
with the technological safety standards.
SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS / PERSONAL PROTECTION

Exposure) Permissible
Concentration
Carbon Black 1333-86-4 TWA (inhalable fraction) 3 mg/m3 ACGIH
TWA 3.5 mg/m3 OSHA Z-1
8.2 Exposure Controls:
Ventilation and Engineering Controls: Use with adequate ventilation to ensure
exposure levels are maintained below the limits
provided above.
The following information on appropriate Personal Protective Equipment is provided to assist
employers in complying with OSHA regulations found in 29 CFR Subpart I (beginning at 1910.132), or
standards of EU member states (including EN 149 for respiratory PPE, and EN 166 for face/eye
