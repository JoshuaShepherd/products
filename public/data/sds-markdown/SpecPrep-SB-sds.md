clothing and shoes. Wash contaminated clothing thoroughly with water
before removing it, or wear gloves. Continue to rinse for at least 10
minutes. Chemical burns must be treated promptly by a physician. Wash
clothing before reuse. Clean shoes thoroughly before reuse.
Ingestion: Get medical attention immediately. Call a poison center or physician.
Wash out mouth with water. Remove dentures if any. Remove victim to
fresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If

small amounts of water to drink. Stop if the exposed person feels sick as
vomiting may be dangerous. Do not induce vomiting unless directed to
do so by medical personnel. If vomiting occurs, the head should be kept
low so that vomit does not enter the lungs. Chemical burns must be
treated promptly by a physician. Never give anything by mouth to an
unconscious person. If unconscious, place in recovery position and get
medical attention immediately. Maintain an open airway. Loosen tight

Inform the relevant authorities if the product has caused environmental pollution (sewers, waterways,
soil or air).
Methods and materials for containment and cleaning up:
Stop leak if without risk. Move containers from spill area. Approach release from upwind. Prevent
entry into sewers, water courses, basements or confined areas. Wash spillages into an effluent
treatment plant or proceed as follows. Contain and collect spillage with non-combustible, absorbent
material e.g. sand, earth, vermiculite or diatomaceous earth and place in container for disposal

processed. Workers should wash hands and face before eating, drinking and smoking. Removed
contaminated clothing and protective equipment before entering eating areas. See also Section 8 for
additional information on hygiene measures.
Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities:
Store between the following temperatures: 2 to 40°C (35.6 to 104°F). Store in accordance with local
regulations. Store in original container protected from direct sunlight in a dry, cool and well-ventilated
area, away from incompatible materials (see Section 10) and food and drink. Store locked up. Keep
container tightly closed and sealed until ready to sue. Containers that have been opened must be
carefully resealed and kept upright to prevent leakage. Do not store in unlabeled containers. Use
appropriate containment to avoid environmental contamination.

Environmental exposure controls: Emissions from ventilation or work process
equipment should be checked to ensure they
comply with the requirements of environmental
protection legislation. In some cases, fume
scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to
the process equipment will be necessary to
reduce emissions to acceptable levels.
Individual protection measures:
Hygiene measures: Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after
handling chemical products, before eating,
smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of
the working period. Appropriate techniques
should be used to remove potentially
contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated
clothing before reusing. Ensure that eye wash
stations and safety showers are close to the
workstation location.
Eye/face protection: Safety eyewear complying with an approved
standard should be used when a risk
assessment indicates this is necessary to avoid
exposure to liquid splashes, mists, gases or
dusts. If contact is possible, the following
protection should be worn, unless the
assessment indicates a higher degree of
protection: chemical splash goggles and/or face
shield. If inhalation hazards exist, a full-face
respirator may be required instead.
Hand protection: Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves
complying with an approved standard should be
worn at all times when handling chemical
products if a risk assessment indicates this is
necessary. Considering the parameters
specified by the glove manufacturer, check
during use that gloves are still retaining their
protective properties. It should be noted that the
time to breakthrough for any glove material may
be different for different glove manufacturers. In

SECTION 13 - DISPOSAL CONSIDERATIONS
Disposal Methods:
The generation of waste should be avoided or minimized wherever possible. Disposal of this product,
solutions and any by-products should at all times comply with the requirements of environmental
protection and waste disposal legislation and any regional local authority requirements. Dispose of
surplus and non-recyclable products via a licensed waste disposal contractor. Waste should not be
disposed of untreated to the sewer unless fully compliant with the requirements of all authorities with
jurisdiction. Waste packaging should be recycled. Incineration or landfill should only be considered
when recycling is not feasible. This material and its container must be disposed of in a safe way. Care
should be taken when handling emptied containers that have not been cleaned or rinsed out. Empty
containers or liners may retain some product residues. Avoid dispersal of spilled containers or liners
may retain some product residues. Avoid dispersal of spilled material and runoff and contact with soil,
waterways, drains and sewers.

Inhalation: If breathing becomes difficult, remove victim to fresh air. If necessary,
use artificial respiration to support vital functions. Seek medical
attention.
Ingestion: If product is swallowed, call physician or poison center if you feel unwell.
If professional advice is not available, do not induce vomiting. Never
induce vomiting or give dilutents (milk or water) to someone who is
unconscious, having convulsions, or who cannot swallow. Seek medical
advice. Take a copy of the label and/or SDS with the victim to the health
professional.
