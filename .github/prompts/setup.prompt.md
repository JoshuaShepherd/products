This app is a product & label management system for a concrete chemical company with several hundred products. Currently the label system is built to generate two different label sizes.

The label system is built to generate from the database and connect through some script (I believe in vercel) in order to convert to HTML/CSS for later conversion to PDF.

There are two CSS templates -- one for each size.

And I believe the HTML template currently exists in the script, but I'm not sure about the process and would like to refine it since you're clear that our desired outcome is a label that matches the HTML/CSS template we desire, for conversion ultimately to PDF.

Start with the products_rows.csv and comprehensively design the database for products according to your expertise in this area.
