    'Clean Lift 20/20', 'clean-lift-2020', 'Premium reactive water-based tilt-up Cure/Bondbreaker', 'Désactivateur à base d''eau réactif', 'Antiadherente reactivo en base agua', 'CLEAN LIFT 20/20 is a chemically reactive water based tilt-up cure/bond breaker specifically engineered to provide a clean, easy lift of tilt-up panels and meet the moisture retention of ASTM C309. CLEAN LIFT 20/20 contains no diesel, kerosene, waxes or silicones.

  Easily identifiable on the casting bed
  Clean panels lift easier, no resin stains
  VOC Compliant:  350g/l
  Resists foot traffic abrasion', 'Mix Design: The frequent use of Type II cement and pozzolans (flyash and slag) in casting beds and panel concrete typically slow the rate of hydration, and may delay or reduce bleed making the casting bed and panel concrete more susceptible to drying shrinkage and increase surface porosity at the time of the Clean Lift application. This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels.

The use of SpecChem "Intrafilm" as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.



Curing New Concrete:
Clean Lift 20/20 must be mixed or agitated before each use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied immediately after the final hard steel troweling at 250-350 sq ft per gal, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results.



Bond Breaker Coat:
Casting slab must be well cured, smooth and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply 300-400 sq ft per gal to the point of rejection. Wait until dry then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gal. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven due to light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bondbreaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet the affected areas with water to lift concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply Clean Lift 20/20. Hold squeegee to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is fully dry.



Bond Breaker Coat on Older/Weather Cured Concrete:
Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds. Remove all laitance that will affect bond breaker performance. Clean Lift 20/20 should be applied to the clean, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcements, spray apply at 300-400 sq ft per gal to the point of rejection. Wait until dry then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat.


Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply CLEAN LIFT 20/20 to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Do not apply additional coats dry. As levels of light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary. The application rate can vary greatly depending upon the roughness of the slab and the ambient conditions. It is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure the even presence of CLEAN LIFT 20/20 at the surface of the casting slab prior to pouring concrete.



Before Pouring Concrete:
Ensure that the entire treated surface has a dry soap/wax like feel to the touch. Test casting slab by sprinkling a few drops of water in several places. The water should not penetrate and may bead like on a newly waxed car. Fog the entire slab with water prior to pouring. When pouring concrete, avoid scouring the casting slab surface by using a deflection board. Heavy rains or rains prior to bond breaker coats drying may necessitate reapplication.



Stack Panels/Waste slabs:
Extra care must be used with stack panels and waste slabs as they tend to be more porous and can transfer water across their interface increasing the possibility of the “osmotic effect” thus leading to sticking. It is recommended that a SpecChem Cure & Seal or a double coat of bond breaker be applied as the cure coat prior to the bond breaker coat to lessen the chance of sticking.


Please contact SpecChem technical service for special instructions on Casting Slabs or Stack Panels and when using concrete mixes containing pozzolans (slag, fly ash).



Painting of Panels:
If Clean Lift 20/20 has been properly applied and has not been over applied, painting of the panels can be performed as soon as the moisture content in the concrete is at an acceptable level for the paint manufacturer. Coating manufacturer’s instructions for surface preparation must be followed and supersedes information in this data sheet.



Other instructions:
Do not apply in rain or if rain is forecast within 12 hours of application. Panels exposed to rain may require reapplication: 600-700 sq ft per gal. Not recommended for use as a thin breaker on smooth or rough formed surface. Apply for best results with a power sprayer or low pressure sprayer (Chapin, Hudson, etc) with a 1/2 gallon/min tip at a 40 psi pressure stream. Always ensure the complete presence of bond breaker prior to pouring panels.', NULL, NULL, 'Do not allow to freeze! Store material in the original tightly closed containers. Do not allow the accumulation of water, dirt, or other contaminants. Store CLEAN LIFT 20/20 between 45-85 degrees F.

Poly Fix® can be used to penetrate hairline cracks or mixed with dry sand to patch/repair concrete spalls or control joints. Poly Fix®’s water-like consistency also makes it an excellent crack healer/sealer for deteriorated concrete surfaces. Poly Fix® contains low VOC’s.
Primary Applications for Poly Fix® are:
- Bridge Decks/Parking Decks
- Auto/truck repair bays
- Concrete crack healer/sealer
- Concrete subjected to mild chemical attack
- Anchoring bolts, railings, equipment
- Floor restoration projects
- Repairing spalls and pop-outs
- Repairs freezer floors down to 0°F', 'Surface Preparation: All concrete to be repaired must be clean, dry and sound. New Concrete must be a minimum of 30 days old. All contaminants, oil, debris, coatings and unsound concrete must be removed.


Cracks should be prepared with a crack chaser, dry diamond blade, wet wheel on a hand grinder or a vacuum blast method. For surface patching applications hot and cold joints properly prepared with a crack chasing hammer, needle gun or diamond grinder. 4” large diameter bits conform to ICRI CSP 5-7 should be used. All spalls and patch areas require that heavy loose or unsound concrete be removed to a depth of at least 1/8”.


Cartridge Mixing: Poly Fix® should be conditioned to a temperature of 60°F to 80°F. Thoroughly shake the cartridge for 30 sec to mix each component. Remove the cap and holding upright, attach the flow restrictor to the cartridge then the static mixer with nut. Insert into dual cartridge and point the static mixer into a waste receptacle and dispense 4-5 inches of material to ensure proper mix. Once dispensing has started, do not turn upright to prevent backflow. Immediately apply the mixed product to the repair area.
Bulk Mixing: Poly Fix® is a very rapid-setting product. Therefore larger bulk mix units (2gal & 1gal) should be mixed in quart batches. Mix 1 pint Part A with 1 pint Part B for 30 sec then add up to 2 quarts of dry sand or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C, mix for an additional 15 sec and immediately place into the prepared repair area.
Placement: For cracks or patching repairs greater than 3/4" wide. Pre-wet the area with Poly Fix® and fill with coarse dry sand (16/40) or use SpecPoxy Mortar Part C to the proper elevation. Immediately saturate the sand with Poly Fix® resin, allowing to saturate the sand by means of the primed substrate. Apply additional sand if necessary while the resin fills and binds to the level of the surface. As Poly Fix® cures, the resin dries and hardens with full bearing. If necessary, sanding, grinding or polishing can begin 1-3 hours after initial cure.
Low Temperature Repairs: Condition Poly Fix® and any other materials (sand) to 70°F before mixing and applying in areas subject to cold. Cure time will be extended depending on the application area.', '- Easy 1 to 1 mix ratio
- Penetrates concrete to seal against liquid absorption
- Rapid installation saves time and labor
- Dark amber color when mixed, dries gray
- Cures in 10 min @ 75°F
- Structurally restores concrete surfaces
- Tough permanent repairs
- VOC compliant (0 VOC’s)', '1 gallon of Poly Fix® when mixed with 2 gallons of dry 16/40 sand will yield approximately 2.2 gallons of durable polymer concrete.

Do not allow any moisture or the accumulation of water, dirt or other contaminants. The shelf life of properly stored Poly Fix® is 9 months from date of manufacture.', '- Poly Fix® must be thoroughly mixed to completely disperse the pigment. This is especially important with the cartridges. Improper mixing/pigment dispersion may result in a white appearance for the cured Poly Fix®
- Poly Fix® is a rigid material and should not be used in moving cracks or joints
- Only apply to concrete free of moisture
- Store indoors at 45°F to 90°F
- Product may discolor in outdoor (strong sunlight) environments
- When using a cartridge, do not hold vertical after pumping to prevent backflow into the cartridge. If material hardens in the mixer, detach and replace with new mixer
- Components may cause irritation. Avoid contact with eyes and skin
- Apply only over dry concrete surfaces
- If HVAC intake ducts will distribute odor into adjoining occupied areas of the building, care should be taken to block these ventilation vents.

As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the predampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
Mix 4.75 - 5.0 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill or mortar mixer. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by slowly adding the RepCon® 928 powder. For non-DOT applications, up to 5.25 pints can be used for greater flow. Mix 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period.
Placement: Trowel, or screed RepCon® 928 firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. Finish RepCon® 928 level with the surrounding concrete and allow to take an initial set. After the initial set, when RepCon® 928 is surface hard, finish by hand trowelling. Excessive troweling is not required.
Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to best match the surrounding concrete. Do not add additional water to the surface during finishing. Lightly spray SpecFilm as a finishing aid on this and any other polymer modified mortars to assist in finishing. In all DOT applications or severe drying conditions (hot/dry or windy), curing should begin as soon as possible using wet burlap, a curing compound, or other approved method. Do not use solvent-based curing compounds.


DEEP APPLICATIONS

For DOT and heavy traffic applications (bridge deck, roadways, parking structures, etc) over 1”, RepCon® 928 should be extended with clean, SSD, 3/8” aggregate up to 60% by weight (30lbs). Greater extension will create a stiffer more lean mortar. Choose a clean (free of organic material) well-graded 3/8” aggregate. Aggregate should be pre-dampened prior to mixing with RepCon® 928. The total mixing water for the batch shall be reduced by the amount of free water found in the aggregate. 60% extension will add approx. 0.18 cu-ft.', '• One-component, dry-polymer modified. Just add water.

Excessive temperature differential and/or high humidity can shorten the shelf life expectancy. Store in a cool, dry area away from direct sunlight.', 'Minimum thickness for horizontal repairs subjected to heavy or severe traffic is 1/2”. Do not retemper after initial mixing. Do not add other cements or additives to this product. RepCon® 928 is a fast-setting product, so mixing equipment should be cleaned with water as soon as possible. Use only potable water for mixing.
Application range 40°F to 90°F. Please consult SpecChem for special instructions on any application outside this temperature range.
Adverse Weather Application: In adverse temperatures, follow ACI recommendations for hot/cold weather concreting practices. For optimum results, condition material to between 65°F and 85°F.
Cold Weather applications should follow procedures outlined in ACI 306. Conditioning the material before mixing to 65°F and 85°F, heating the repair area, using warm water for mixing, and tenting or insulating the patch area after application will increase strength development. Do not use direct, unvented heat on the patch after installation. Do not allow repairs to freeze until the material has reached a minimum of 1000 psi compressive strength.
Caution: Contains Portland cement and sand. Cement will cause irritation. Avoid contact. A dust respirator, safety goggles, and rubber gloves are recommended. Avoid prolonged contact with clothing.

Remove all oil, grease, dirt, laitance, curing compounds, and any other foreign matter by sandblasting, mechanical abrasion, or hydro-blasting. Clean drilled holes with a nylon brush to remove all dust and loose material. Use clean, oil-free compressed air to blow out any remaining water, dust, or debris before application. Ensure bolts, rebar, or threaded rods are free of dirt, grease, or oil.Bonding: As a structural adhesive, apply SpecPoxy 3000 neat and work into the substrate. The glue line should not exceed 1/8”.Anchoring:  For anchoring dowels, bolts, or reinforcing steel, the hole depth should be approximately nine times the bolt diameter. Ensure the hole is properly prepared, drilled, brushed, and blown out before preparing the epoxy. Dispense into a disposable container until a uniform grey is achieved with no streaks.Into Concrete: Dispense the material from the bottom of the hole, filling approximately 5/8 of the hole depth while slowly withdrawing the nozzle. Insert the bolt or dowel by turning it slowly during insertion. Ensure the hole is completely filled with SpecPoxy 3000 and devoid of air pockets or voidsInto Hollow Block:  Completely fill the screen while withdrawing the nozzle. Insert the epoxy-filled screen into the hole and insert the threaded rod to the bottom of the screen while turning slightly clockwise. Do not disturb or bolt up until cured.

Mixing:
Add a small amount of clean water to Super SpecPlug and mix to a putty consistency. Use an approximate ratio of 20% – 21% water to product (by weight). Mix only enough material that can be placed in 2 minutes (approximately 9.5 pints water to 50 lbs of product).

Yield:
One 50 lb (22.7 kg) pail yields approximately 0.5 ft³.

It provides excellent concrete surface treatment and protection. The actual VOC content is 230 grams per liter.', 'Form Release Agent:
Add one 5 gallon pail of TRIACT to a clean, empty 55 gallon drum. Add 50 gallons of a VOC compliant oil or other approved diluent. Agitate well. Spray apply at 1500 ft²/gallon to a properly prepared form surface prior to concrete placement.

Aluminum Form Seasoning Agent:
Add one 5 gallon pail of TRIACT to 10 gallons of a VOC compliant oil or release agent. Agitate well. Apply to new, unseasoned aluminum forms at a rate of 500 ft²/gallon. All form surfaces (front, back & sides) should be treated. Allow the treated forms to sit overnight.

Continue to use TRIACT mixture as a release agent for 4-5 additional concrete pours before converting back to Spec Strip Plus or another quality reactive form release.

Concrete Softener/Remover:
Remove as much of the loose concrete build up as possible using a high pressure power washer. The surfaces to be coated should be reasonably dry prior to treatment. Apply undiluted TRIACT generously (100-500 ft²/gallon) to areas with existing heavy buildup. Allow build-up to soften for 6-8 hours and remove with a scraper or a power washer. Heavy buildup will generally require multiple coats to fully soften buildup. Difficult to remove build up may require the use of SPECBLAST.

Maintenance Coating:
Every 3-4 weeks, or when your aluminum forms start to develop a concrete build up or a concrete scum, apply a mixture of one 5 gallon pail of TRIACT to a drum of SpecChem Form Release Agent. Agitate well before use and apply the TRIACT/form release mixture as your form release @ a rate of 1000-1500 sq-ft per gallon. The TRIACT will act as a self cleaning additive to your daily forming operation without removing your forms from use. Repeat until build-up and scum are removed.

Protective Barrier:
Use undiluted TRIACT to prevent concrete adhesion and build-up by applying to clean concrete placement equipment such as laser screeds, power trowels, concrete buckets, concrete paving machines, chutes, shovels, screeds, etc. Equipment in concrete block plants can be kept free of build-up by spraying a light coat on mixers, hoppers and chutes.

Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineer-approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface. Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB, and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time. As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush.

IntraCon’s unique formulation prevents liquid penetration by creating a non-soluble physical barrier over the concrete. IntraCon is recommended for any concrete structure, especially foundations, swimming pools and underground structures. IntraCon can additionally be used as a concrete waterproofing admixture.', 'Surface Preparation: The surface must be structurally sound, clean and free of dirt, release agent, efflorescence, curing compounds, laitance, and other contaminants. Remove form marks and other protrusions to prevent “show through”. Surface must have an open capillary system to provide grip for the IntraCon. If concrete has a smooth finish sandblasting is recommended to lightly roughen the concrete surface. Repair all surface defects with IntraCon Mortar. Moisten the application area and allow to dry for 10 minutes. IntraCon requires a water-saturated surface during application. Wet concrete surface thoroughly with potable water, and remove excess water (ponding) before IntraCon is applied. It is essential that the concrete surface does not dry before IntraCon is applied if concrete surface does dry rewet the area.
Mixing: Mix IntraCon with potable water to reach a thin cake batter consistency. Recommended ratios for brush application is 5 parts powder to 2 parts water. For spray application use 5 parts powder to 3 parts water. IntraCon needs to be applied within 20 minutes after mixing.

(Admixing: When IntraCon is used as additive, IntraCon must be added to the concrete in the final batching. Dosage Rate: 1.7-2.0% by weight of cement.)

For patching or repair applications use 15% of water/50 lbs bag of IntraCon.

Placement: If IntraCon is being applied by a hand brush or broom then just two mix ratios are used. Apply in a thin uniform thick coating no thicker than 1/16th of an inch. If the project requires a second application wait until the first coat has set before applying the second. A second coat should not be applied after a time period of 2 days. IntraCon should not be applied in rainy or cold conditions (below 40°F).

Application: A fine tip sprayer should be used to lightly wet the surface of the IntraCon once it has set. Typically the surface should be wet with water multiple times a day. In cases of high temperatures, winds and low humidity more applications will be necessary. IntraCon must be protected from direct sun and excessive high temperatures as drying time affects H2O hours.

LithSeal SG can be used alone or in combination with other reactive sealer/densifiers such as SpecHard or LithSeal SC to give concrete floors a glossy finish, harder surface, and protective chemically resistant seal.', 'Always apply LithSeal SG to a clean surface free of cures, bond breakers, oil, dirt, grease, or debris. Clean concrete surfaces with SpecChem Orange Peel Citrus Cleaner and neutralize with a neutral pH detergent. Thoroughly flush with water. LithSeal SG is designed to be applied at the provided concentration. Do not dilute or alter. LithSeal SG may be applied to steel troweled, honed, polished, or highly polished concrete surfaces.**Before Applying LithSeal SG**:1. Lightly wet a clean microfiber pad with LithSeal SG and wring out excess, leaving the pad damp.2. Working from one control joint to another, apply a light, fine spray of LithSeal SG to a small section of the floor using a clean pump-up sprayer fitted with a 0.5 gpm spray tip.3. Using the damp microfiber pad and firm downward pressure, immediately spread the LithSeal SG to produce a thin, even coating. Spread the product as far as possible while maintaining a wet edge. Properly applied, LithSeal SG dries quickly. Stop spreading once drying begins. Avoid overlapping.4. Allow drying to be tack-free, typically 20-60 minutes.5. Once dry, burnish LithSeal SG using a high-speed burnisher fitted with a burnishing pad or equivalent. Polishing the treated surface and high-speed burnishing heats the LithSeal SG to help the treatment fuse and bond with the concrete for increased durability and longevity.6. Repeat steps 1-5 above as necessary for the desired finish. Burnish between coats. Apply up to three coats for maximum gloss. Coverage rates will vary with concrete porosity: - Fresh, Uncured, Burnished Concrete: 600-1000 ft²/gal - Existing Steel Troweled Concrete: 400-500 ft²/gal - Existing Float Finished Concrete: 250-350 ft²/gal', NULL, NULL, 'When stored in the original, tightly closed container, preventing the accumulation of water, dirt, or other contaminants, the shelf life is one year from the date of manufacture.', 'As every project and application can vary, it is the contractor’s responsibility to determine compatibility by performing field tests simulating actual jobsite conditions.

Exterior Applications: When using Por-Rok® Products for exterior applications where excessive standing water is present, CGM recommends the use of Super Por-Rok®. In cases where aluminum railings are being installed, CGM HIGHLY recommends the use of Super Por-Rok® for all environmental conditions; however one of the two following options MUST be used in standing water environments to achieve optimum bond strength and performance. 
OPTION 1: Once the POR-ROK® is set (15 min.), mix and additional amount of POR-ROK® with slightly less water and cone the material above the anchor. Prevent water from settling on the surface and possibly damaging the installation. 
OPTION 2: Fill the hole with POR-ROK® flush to the top of the concrete. 7 days after installation seal with any sealer rated for exterior use. FAILURE TO PROPERLY MITIGATE STANDING WATER FROM POR-ROK® WILL RESULT IN POSSIBLE PRODUCT FAILURE.

RAPID FLEX CJ allows for joints to be shaved quickly for fast turnaround. RAPID FLEX CJ has been designed for use in compliance with ACI 302, section 4.10 recommendations for joint fillers used in saw cut/control joints with a Shore A Durometer of 85. RAPID FLEX CJ can also be used for the repair of damaged or spalled joint nosing and cracks. RAPID FLEX CJ is also available in 4 additional architectural colors.

To remove the above, use a vacuum equipped, dry cut abrasive blade and oil-free compressed air to remove any debris and dust prior to applying RAPID FLEX CJ.
Per ACI and PCA guidelines, Rapid Flex CJ should be installed full depth in sawcut control joints and a minimum of 2/3 joint depth in random cracks. No joint sealer or compressible backer rod is required. RAPID FLEX CJ should be applied to a minimum depth of 1/2 inch.
Mixing instructions: Temperature of RAPID FLEX CJ must be 50°F or above at the time of mixing. Stir/shake each component before dispensing. Use a 1:1 low pressure dual-component, proportioned metered pump with a 3/8” x 24” element static mixer.
Application: When using a cartridge or plural component pump, dispense mixed material into a waste container to assure a uniform color and a consistent 1:1 ratio. Then dispense properly mixed RAPID FLEX CJ into the prepared joint. Joints should be overfilled and allowed to cure for approximately 1 hour and up to 24 hours before shaving flush with a floor razor scraper. The cut joint must be flush with the floor to effectively transfer wheel loads.
Stain Protection: Since RAPID FLEX CJ sets so quickly, the potential for any overfill to stain the sides of the joint is unlikely. In applications where aesthetic and decorative or architectural finishes are critical, we recommend using Spec CJ Guard as a stain protectant and also to facilitate shaving.
If RAPID FLEX CJ is installed in a floor before maximum shrinkage has occurred, a crack may appear either adhesively or cohesively.

The cut joint must be flush with the floor to effectively transfer wheel loads.


Stain Protection: Since RAPID FLEX CJ sets so quickly, the potential for any overfill to stain the sides of the joint is unlikely. In applications where aesthetic and decorative or architectural finishes are critical, we recommend using Spec CJ Guard as a stain protectant and also to facilitate shaving.


If RAPID FLEX CJ is installed in a floor before maximum shrinkage has occurred, a crack may appear either adhesively or cohesively. This should not be considered a failure of the RAPID FLEX CJ, which will continue to support the joint edge and transfer wheel loads. To remedy the situation, clean and out the crack, wipe clean with SpecChem Solvent 100 and refill with RAPID FLEX CJ.', NULL, NULL, 'Store Rapid Flex CJ in its original containers and keep tightly closed between 55-90°F.

Always test a small amount of Rapid Flex CJ to verify that the product has been thoroughly mixed and will harden properly before proceeding. Rapid Flex CJ should not be installed on new concrete floors until maximum shrinkage has occurred. ACI 302 recommends a minimum of 30 days and preferably 90 days for all semi-rigid polyureas and epoxies. The longer the time period allowed for curing the concrete prior to installation of Rapid Flex CJ, the better the performance.

For maximum durability, saw cut the perimeter of the repair 1/8” deeper than the depth of the repair, creating a notched, reinforced edge. Mechanically abrade the surface by an engineered approved method in accordance with ICRI 310.2 Guideline to a minimum CSP 5. All concrete surfaces to be repaired must be in a saturated-surface-damp (SSD) condition with no standing water on the surface.
Priming/Scrub Coat: Thoroughly clean all exposed steel reinforcing of rust and coat with SpecPrep SB. Prepared concrete must be SSD and primed with a spray or brush coat of SpecPrep SB and the repair mortar applied wet on wet or up to the recommended open time (see SpecPrep SB technical data sheet).
As an alternative, apply a scrub coat of the properly mixed repair mortar by scrubbing a thin layer into the pre-dampened substrate with a stiff brush. Place the repair mortar immediately before the bond coat dries.
Mixing: Mix 6.25 – 6.75 pints (depending on desired consistency) of clean water per 50 pound bag of material. Mix with a low speed drill. Add recommended amount of clean water into the container, followed by the RepCon® V/O mix. Mix 2-3 minutes. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period. RepCon® V/O can be applied in applications from 1/4” to 2” in a lift.
Placement: Trowel RepCon® V/O firmly into the prepared area, ensuring intimate contact with the bonding surface. After the initial set, when RepCon® V/O is surface hard, shave the material to the desired final shape using a steel trowel. Maximum depth of neat repair mortar is 2” for each lift. Additional lifts can be placed after the original lift has achieved its final set. The original lift should be left with a rough surface to promote bonding between lifts.
Finishing/Curing: Finish the repair material to the desired texture to match the surrounding concrete. RepCon® V/O is self-curing under most conditions. In severe drying conditions, use an ASTM C309 compliant, water based SpecChem curing compound.', 'Polymer modified, fiber reinforced, single-component mix', 'Dependent on application thickness and area size.

To assure proper adhesion, a field test should be performed to confirm performance. In general, if SpecPrime can achieve proper adhesion without peeling, then a SpecFlow overlay will be acceptable. Proper substrate preparation is essential. Consult SpecChem for further information.
PURPOSE: Sleek 1000 SLU can be used to level or smooth interior floors. It can be used on new construction projects to correct rough, unfinished, or uneven floors.
PREPARATION: To prepare surface, follow all standard ACI recommendations. Remove all dirt, gas, oil, grease, asphalt, paint, curing compounds, and all loose surface materials. Concrete substrates should be profiled to a minimum CSP#3, shot blasting is preferred.
PRIMING: Prime all surfaces with SpecPrime at approximately 100 - 150 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply with a brush or broom. Not for leave coverage will depend upon the condition and texture of the surface. Very porous surfaces will require two applications of primer. Allow SpecPrime to dry before applying Sleek 1000 SLU.
MIXING: Pour 5 1/2 quarts of water into a mixing vessel, then add one 50 pound bag of Sleek 1000 SLU. With a slow speed drill and a heavy duty mixing drill (650 rpm), mix for 2 to 3 minutes until mixture is smooth and free of lumps. Do not add more than 5 1/2 quarts of water per 50 pound bag. Over watering can cause separation and reduce strength. Mix only what can be applied within the setting period.
INSTALLATION: Pour Sleek 1000 SLU over the substrate spreading the material with a long handled spreader. SLEEK 1000 SLU can be pumped using an appropriately sized grout pump. For more information on grout pumps and pumping, please contact SpecChem.
No troweling is necessary. SLEEK 1000 SLU will level itself during the first 20 minutes at 70°F, and will accept foot traffic in 2-4 hours depending upon jobsite conditions.

SpecLevel PCT produces a dense, hard surface that can be diamond polished in as little as 24 hours. Mix SpecLevel PCT with water, pour or pump, and it will seek its own level to produce a smooth, hard, wearable surface. SpecLevel PCT dries to a light concrete gray and will accept integral color or stains.', 'SpecLevel PCT can be applied in thicknesses ranging from a minimum 3/8” up to 1.5”. It can be installed up to 5” in thickness with the addition of pea gravel. Floors subjected to high-load rubber-wheeled traffic require a minimum of 1/2”. SpecLevel PCT will develop a superior bond to the substrate and will normally accept foot traffic within 3 to 4 hours, depending upon heat, humidity, and other job site conditions.Preparation: To prepare the surface, follow all standard ACI recommendations. Remove all dirt, gas, oil, grease, asphalt, paint, curing compounds, and all loose surface materials. Concrete substrates should be profiled to a minimum CSP #4. Shot blasting is preferred.Priming: Prime all surfaces with SpecPoxy 1000 at approximately 100 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply with a notched squeegee, broom, or roller to assure complete coverage. Coverage will depend upon the condition and texture of the surface. While the epoxy is still wet (max. 30 min.), broadcast coarse dry sand (16/40 or minus 30 gradation) to the point of refusal (approximately 1 lb. of dry sand per sq ft). Allow to dry a minimum of 12 hours and remove any loose sand with a broom and vacuum before applying SpecLevel PCT.Mixing: Pour 7.5 pints of water into a mixing container, then add a 50-pound bag of SpecLevel PCT. Mix for a minimum of 3 minutes with a blending paddle attached to a heavy-duty drill (650 rpm) or a Helix Mixer until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps. To reduce flow for a thicker consistency, add 7 pints of water per 50 lbs of powder. Do not overwater or retemper. When mixing larger batches (3-4 bags in a large mixer), mix for a minimum of 4-5 minutes to ensure homogenous consistency. For pumping applications, mix for a minimum of 3 minutes in the pump’s mixing tank. SpecLevel PCT can be extended by adding 15 pounds of clean 3/8” pea gravel for each 50 pounds of product. First, mix SpecLevel PCT as instructed. During the last minute of mixing, add the required aggregate. Should a finish coat be required, apply a non-extended layer of SpecLevel PCT after the first extended layer has hardened and been re-primed with another layer of SpecPoxy 1000 and sand.Installation: Pour SpecLevel PCT over the substrate, spreading the material with a long-handled spreader or gauge rake. SpecLevel PCT can be pumped using an appropriately sized grout pump. No troweling is necessary. SpecLevel PCT will level itself during the first 20 minutes at 70°F and will accept foot traffic in 2-4 hours depending upon job site conditions. We recommend wearing cleated shoes when installing SpecLevel PCT. Do not install SpecLevel PCT when the average daily temperature is less than 45°F. During hot weather, work quickly and use cold water for mixing, as the average working time will decrease.

SpecLevel PCT-AGG produces a dense, hard surface that can be diamond polished in as little as 24 hours. Mix SpecLevel PCT-AGG with water, pour or pump, and it will seek its own level to produce a smooth, hard, wearable surface.', 'SpecLevel PCT-AGG can be applied in thicknesses ranging from a minimum 3/8” to 1.5”. It can be installed up to 5” in thickness with the addition of pea gravel. Floors subjected to high-load rubber-wheeled traffic require a minimum of 1/2”. SpecLevel PCT-AGG will develop a superior bond to the substrate and will normally accept foot traffic within 3 to 4 hours depending upon heat, humidity, and other job site conditions.Preparation: To prepare the surface, follow all standard ACI recommendations. Remove all dirt, gas, oil, grease, asphalt, paint, curing compounds, and all loose surface materials. Concrete substrates should be profiled to a minimum CSP #4. Shot blasting is preferred.Priming: Prime all surfaces with SpecPoxy 1000 at approximately 100 sq. ft. per gallon. Apply with a notched squeegee, broom, or roller to assure complete coverage. Coverage will depend upon the condition and texture of the surface. While the epoxy is still wet (max. 30 min.), broadcast coarse dry sand (16/40 or minus 30 gradation) to the point of refusal (approximately 1 lb. of dry sand per sq ft). Allow to dry a minimum of 12 hours and remove any loose sand with a broom and vacuum before applying SpecLevel PCT-AGG.Mixing: Pour 7.5 pints of water into a mixing container, depending on desired consistency, then add a 50-pound bag of SpecLevel PCT-AGG. Mix for a minimum of 3 minutes with a blending paddle attached to a heavy-duty drill (650 rpm) or a Helix Mixer until the mixture is smooth and free of lumps. To reduce flow for a thicker consistency, add 6.5 pints of water per 50 lbs of powder. Do not overwater or retemper. When mixing larger batches (3-4 bags in a large mixer), mix for a minimum of 4-5 minutes to ensure a homogenous consistency. For pumping applications, mix for a minimum of 3 minutes in the pump’s mixing tank. SpecLevel PCT-AGG can be extended by adding 15 pounds of clean 3/8” pea gravel for each 50 pounds of product. First mix SpecLevel PCT-AGG as instructed. During the last minute of mixing, add the required aggregate. Should a finish coat be required, apply a non-extended layer of SpecLevel PCT-AGG after the first extended layer has hardened and been re-primed with another layer of SpecPoxy 1000 and sand.Installation: Pour SpecLevel PCT-AGG over the substrate, spreading the material with a long-handled spreader or gauge rake. SpecLevel PCT-AGG can be pumped using an appropriately sized grout pump. No troweling is necessary. SpecLevel PCT-AGG will level itself during the first 20 minutes at 70°F and will accept foot traffic in 2-4 hours depending upon job site conditions. We recommend wearing cleated shoes when installing SpecLevel PCT-AGG. Do not install SpecLevel PCT-AGG when the average daily temperature is less than 45°F. During hot weather, work quickly and use cold water for mixing, as the average working time will decrease.

Enlarging Cracks: For best results, enlarge the crack to at least 3/4″ in width and depth, ensuring a square or undercut shape.
Cleaning: Remove all grease, wax, oil, contaminants, curing compounds, and any weak, contaminated, or deteriorated concrete from the substrate.
Wetting Surface: Saturate the repair area with water. SpecPlug can cure in the presence of running water, making it ideal for active leaks.
Mixing and Application
Mixing SpecPlug:
Create a putty-like consistency by adding a small amount of clean water to SpecPlug. Aim for a 20%-21% water-to-product ratio by weight.
Mix only enough material that can be placed within 2 minutes.
Application Procedure:
For vertical and moving-water applications, hold the mixed SpecPlug firmly in place until it sets, typically within about 3 minutes.
Adjust water temperature to manage the setting time: use hot water and warm material in cold conditions, and cold water in hot conditions.
Curing
Curing: Keep SpecPlug damp for at least 30 minutes to support curing. Optimal strength is achieved through wet curing for up to 2 days.', 'Single-component, easy to use by just adding water.

Applications on concrete or steel for SPECPOXY COATING CLEAR are:

  Food/chemical processing plants
  Auto/truck repair bays
  Warehouse floors
  Manufacturing plants
  Floor restoration projects', 'Concrete Surface Preparation: New Concrete must be a minimum of 28 days old and possess an open surface texture with all curing compounds and sealers removed. The concrete must be clean and sound. All oil, dirt, debris, paint and unsound concrete must be removed. The surface should be prepared mechanically using sandblast, shotblast or scarifier, which will give an open surface profile.
Acid etching is acceptable only when mechanical preparation is impractical. The salts left by the acid reaction must be thoroughly removed by pressure washing. Allow the concrete to completely dry. NOTE: Even with proper procedures, an acid etched surface may not provide as strong a bond as mechanical preparation procedures. Also, acid etching will not remove oil, grease, sealers and other materials that will interfere with the bond on the surface of the concrete.
Steel Surface Preparation: All metal surfaces to be coated must be free of contaminants such as paint, oil and grease and sand blasted down to white metal.
Joints and Edges: If the floor is subjected to heavy wheel traffic, the edges of the floor should be sawcut 1/4” deep to locked in the edge. Moving joints as in the case of expansion joints should be maintained through the coating. All cracks over 1/16” wide should be filled. Use a 100% solids epoxy mortar to fill wide cracks, joints and keyed edges.
Mixing: All materials should be conditioned to temperature range of 60°F to 90°F. Mix parts A and part B separately for one minute using a drill and mixing prop. For ease of mixing, add 1 Part B to 2 Parts A (not the reverse). Mix the Part A and Part B together for 3 minutes. The epoxy must be well mixed to ensure proper chemical reaction. After mixing, place immediately.
Placement: This product may be applied by notched squeegee or roller. After application, it is suggested the coating be back rolled with a spiked roller to reduce surface imperfections, entrapped air and to improve bond.
Top Coat: If desired, additional coats of this product or another SpecChem product may be applied just after the initial coating has become tack-free. This could be as early as 4 hours, but must be within 18 hours of initial coating placement. The choice of topcoat is selected based upon chemical and wear resistance desired. Contact your local SpecChem for specific recommendations.', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Store and condition the product indoors at 50°F to 80°F prior to application.

Once dissipated, concrete cured with SpecRez is compatible with most paints, sealers, coating and floor covering adhesives', 'Coverage will vary depending on the texture and porosity of the concrete. Apply at a rate of 200-400 ft²/gal immediately after final trowel (or stripping of forms).', 'Shelf life of SpecRez in the original tightly closed container is 1 year from the date of manufacture.

Do not apply at temperatures below 40°F (4°C).
Keep from freezing. Do not dilute or alter in any way.
Always follow subsequent coating manufacturers’ recommendations for surface preparation.
All resin cures turn yellow while they are dissipating (oxidizing). This is a normal part of the dissipation process.
Broom finish concrete may prolong dissipation.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Use with adequate ventilation.
In case of ingestion, CALL A PHYSICIAN immediately. DO NOT induce vomiting.

If spray applied, brush or broom into the substrate, forming a continuous film over the entire area to be bonded. The coverage rate varies with the porosity of the surface. Drying time is 20-30 minutes at 70°F. PLASTER BOND will remain slightly tacky when dry. Accumulation in low areas should be wiped up. Poor ventilation will delay normal drying time. Fans will help increase air circulation to speed drying time. Under normal conditions, PLASTER BOND can be applied up to 24 hours before the installation of underlayment toppings.

  OTC/VOC compliant less than 350g/l', 'Mix Design: The frequent use of Type 1L cement and pozzolans (flyash and slag) in casting beds and panel concrete typically slow the rate of hydration, and may delay or reduce bleed making the casting bed and panel concrete more susceptible to drying shrinkage and increase surface porosity at the time of the SpecTilt application. This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels. The use of SpecChem “IntraFilm” as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.

Curing New Concrete: Ready-to-use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, SpecTilt EX should be applied immediately after the final steel troweling, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results. The entire slab must be completely covered. When applied on tightly steel troweled concrete, SpecTilt EX meets the moisture retention requirements of ASTM C-309. Typical application for curing is 200-400 sq-ft/gal.

Bondbreaker Coat: Casting slab must be properly cured, smooth, and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. SpecTilt EX should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply at 400 sq ft per gallon or to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gallon. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bond breaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet affected areas with water to fill concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply SpecTilt EX. Allow bond breaker to thoroughly dry.', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'SPECTILT EX dries much faster than standard solvent-based products.

  Tip: When spraying SPECTILT EX keep pressure in pump up sprayers as high as possible to ensure a steady and even spray pattern. Maintain the sprayer tip near the concrete, within 12 inches.

  Avoid over application. SPECTILT EX must be completely dry prior to pouring concrete. Do not walk on bond breaker until completely dry. For best performance, mist the pour area with water immediately before pouring concrete.

  Resists foot traffic abrasion', 'Mix Design: The frequent use of Type 1L cement and pozzolans (flyash and slag) in casting beds and panel concrete typically slow the rate of hydration, and may delay or reduce bleed making the casting bed and panel concrete more susceptible to drying shrinkage and increase surface porosity at the time of the SpecTilt application. This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels. The use of SpecChem “IntraFilm” as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.

Curing New Concrete: SpecTilt WB must be mixed or agitated before each use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, SpecTilt WB should be applied immediately after the final hard steel troweling at 250-350 sq ft per gal. after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results.

Bond Breaker Coat: Casting slab must be well cured, smooth and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. SpecTilt WB should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply @ 400 sq ft per gal or to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500-700 sq ft per gal. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bondbreaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet affected areas with water to fill concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply SpecTilt WB. Allow bondbreaker to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is thoroughly dry.

Bond Breaker Coat on Old or Water Cured Concrete: Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds, salts or other substances that could adversely affect the performance of SpecTilt WB. The slab must be smooth, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels, flood casting slab surface with clean water. Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply SpecTilt WB to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Allow to thoroughly dry. As before, if light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary.

VOC Compliant.
STRIPPER SUPREME is designed specifically for removing multiple layers of sealers, curing compounds and other concrete floor and wall finishes from porous concrete and masonry surfaces. Formulated as a fast working stripper, STRIPPER SUPREME penetrates deep into the multiple layers and reacts with the resins for easy removal of high strength clear coatings, most epoxies, acrylics, hydrocarbon resin-based cures, urethanes, floor enamels and other chemically resistant coatings. May be used on concrete, masonry, wood and metal surfaces. It is immediately emulsifiable in cold or hot water and steam. STRIPPER SUPREME is extremely effective for removal of graffiti as well as most spray paints, inks, crayons, etc. STRIPPER SUPREME is an excellent paint remover.', 'Surface Preparation: Prepare the surface by removing loose, peeling coating using high water pressure or by scraping. Surface should be dry before applying stripper. All glass, metal and painted surfaces should be protected from exposure during the stripping process using polyethylene or other proven protective material. Pedestrian and auto traffic should be diverted and/or protected. Beware of wind drift. Adjacent shrubs and plants should be protected from direct contact.
*Note: SpecChem Stripper Supreme will not attack glass surfaces, however cleaning is normally necessary following coating removal and cleaning solution may damage glass surfaces.

Test Application: SpecChem suggests test panels to be applied prior to overall application to determine precise cleaning procedures and assure desired results. Testing should be oriented towards determining the optimum “dwell time” for the product and the number of applications necessary to completely remove all traces of the coating from the surface.

Application: Apply a thick coat of Stripper Supreme with a synthetic or natural fiber brush, roller or airless sprayer. Sprayers should be fitted with viton, Teflon or other resistant seals or hoses. A minimum one gallon per minute (50 psi) (0.34 MPa) airless sprayer is recommended. If thinning is desirable, dilute with SpecChem Solvent 100.
1. Prepare the surface by thoroughly dry scraping or high pressure spraying to remove all loose or peeling coating. Allow to thoroughly dry if water pressure is used.
2. Apply a thick coating of Stripper Supreme on the surface using a natural fiber brush, roller or (airless) spray equipment.
3. Leave Stripper Supreme on the surface until the desired coating “lifts” or shows indication of dissolving. Stripper Supreme should be left on the surface for a total of 15 to 30 minutes before rinsing.
*Note: Stripper Supreme should not be allowed to dry on the surface. If tests indicate long waiting periods, additional amounts of Stripper Supreme should be applied to prevent drying out.
4. Periodically agitate the Stripper Supreme while on the surface using a stiff bristle brush to improve penetration in the coating.
5. Remove Stripper Supreme and coating residues using high pressure rinsing equipment (400 to 600 psi) (2.8-4.1 MPa) or a garden hose with adjustable nozzle. Adjust the nozzle to provide a concentrated stream of water and flush the Stripper Supreme thoroughly from the surface.
6. Disposal of Stripper Supreme: Contact local, state and federal authorities regarding procedure for proper disposal.
7. Before applying sealers such as SpecChem Deco Shine, Crystal Shine, or Surface Shine, all Stripper Supreme residue must be completely removed. An application of Citrus Cleaner, when used in accordance with the written instructions, is an efficient low cost method of removing all stripper residue.
*Note: High pressure cleaning equipment is recommended for water rinsing the Stripper Supreme and residues from the treated surface. Masonry surfaces are porous and high pressure water (fan spray) may be necessary to thoroughly flush the pigments from the pore of the masonry.

Substrate must be structurally sound and free of grease, oil, dirt or any other contaminants that may adversely affect the bond. Prepared surface must be dust-free and must have sufficient profile to ensure adequate mechanical lock. Substrate must be saturated, surface dry (SSD) and free of standing water.

Mixing and Application Guidelines: Mix designs vary with specific job requirements. Proportioning of sand, cement and STRONG BOND (diluted or neat) ratios achieve different physical properties.

Once the finishing process is completed, undiluted STRONG BOND can be used as a cure. The application instructions highlight typical conditions. (When in doubt, always apply a test patch).

Admixture: When used as an admixture, STRONG BOND can be diluted up to 3 parts with potable water to 1 part STRONG BOND. For increased durability and performance, dilution rates of 2 to 1 and 1 to 1 can be used. Typically, blend one part cement to three parts sand then add enough STRONG BOND until a desired consistency is achieved.

Do not add other cements or additives to this product. TOTAL PATCH is a fast setting product, so mixing equipment should be cleaned with water as soon as possible. Use only potable water for mixing.
Application range 40°F to 90°F. Please consult SpecChem for special instructions on any application outside this temperature range.
Adverse Weather Application: In adverse temperatures, follow ACI recommendations for hot/cold weather concreting practices. For optimum results, condition bagged material to between 65°F and 85°F overnight.
Cold Weather applications should follow procedures outlined in ACI 306. Conditioning the material before mixing to 65°F and 85°F, heating the repair area, using warm water for mixing, and tenting or insulating the patch area after application will increase strength development. Do not use direct, unvented heat on the patch after installation. Do not allow repairs to freeze until the material has reached a minimum of 1000 psi compressive strength.
Caution: Contains Portland cement and sand. Cement will cause irritation. Avoid contact. A dust respirator, safety goggles, and rubber gloves are recommended. Avoid prolonged contact with clothing. In case of contact with eyes, immediately flush with water for at least 15 minutes. Get prompt medical attention. Do not wear contact lenses when working with this product. DO NOT take internally.

Actual VOC content is 45 grams per liter.', 'As jobsite conditions and mix designs (min. 3500 psi) vary, a test panel should always be performed to determine the proper grade of retarder to achieve the desired depth of etch. Climate (temperature) and mix design are key variables that need to be considered for a successful project.
Mix VERSA ETCH thoroughly before each use. Prior to use, protect surrounding surfaces, concrete walks, curbs, etc from overspray and wash down residue.
Place concrete and float, screed or trowel level. For added texture, spread extra aggregate on the surface and trowel or float into the surface, ensuring that each rock is completely surrounded by cement paste.
As soon as surface water has disappeared, use a plastic sprayer and evenly spray a thorough coat of VERSA ETCH over the entire area to be treated. Normal application rate is approximately 200-300 square feet per gallon. Do not apply too sparingly. Versa Etch will dry in 1-2 hours depending on ambient conditions.
Once the VERSA ETCH feels dry to the touch, apply VERSA ETCH EXTENDER over the top of VERSA ETCH. This will help create a more uniform etch and extend the removal time of the VERSA ETCH, especially in hot weather. Coverage for Versa Etch Extender is approximately 400 sq ft per gal.
Anywhere from 6 hours to 24 hours later, flush off the retarded and extender from the concrete with a garden hose and stiff broom, a pressure washer, or a garden hose and floor scrubber with stiff bristle pad.

This premium formulation creates a reliable barrier between the casting slab and concrete panels while allowing for proper concrete curing.
- Chemically reactive cure and bond breaker
- Clean panels - no residue, stain, or discoloration  
- Excellent hold-out properties
- Resists foot traffic abrasion
- Reliable panel release', 'Mix Design: The frequent use of Type 1L cement and pozzolans (flyash and slag) in casting beds and panel concrete typically slow the rate of hydration, and may delay or reduce bleed making the casting bed and panel concrete more susceptible to drying shrinkage and increase surface porosity at the time of the SpecTilt application. This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels. The use of SpecChem "IntraFilm" as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.
Curing New Concrete: Ready-to-use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, SPECTILT 100 should be applied immediately after the final steel troweling, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results. The entire slab must be completely covered. When applied on tightly steel troweled concrete, SPECTILT 100 meets the moisture retention requirements of ASTM C-309. Typical application rate for curing is 200-400 sq-ft/gal.
Bondbreaker Coat: Casting slab must be properly cured, smooth, and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. SPECTILT 100 should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply at 400 sq ft per gallon or to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500 - 700 sq ft per gallon. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bond breaker.
Bondbreaker Coat on Old or Water Cured Concrete: Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds or other substances that could adversely affect the performance of SPECTILT 100. The slab must be smooth, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels, flood casting slab surface with clean water. Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply SPECTILT 100 to the damp slab to the point of rejection, typically 300 - 500 sq ft per gallon. Allow to dry and then apply a second coat at the same rate but at right angles to the previous coat.
Before Pouring Concrete: Verify that the entire treated surface has a dry soap like feel to the touch. Test casting slab by sprinkling a few drops of water in several places. The water should bead up like on a newly waxed car. In hot and/or dry weather, mist or fog the entire slab with water prior to pouring. Avoid scouring the casting slab surface by using a deflection board.
Stack Panels: Extra care must be used with stack panels as they tend to transfer water across their interface, increasing the possibility of the "osmotic effect" that leads to sticking. It is recommended that SPECTILT 100 be applied as the cure coat @ 200-250 sq-ft per gallon prior to the bond breaker coat between each layer to decrease the chance of sticking.

- Quick-drying for maximum productivity
- Chemically reactive
- Clean panels - no residue, stain, or discoloration
- Resists foot traffic abrasion
- Faster turnaround times', 'Mix Design: The frequent use of Type 1L cement and pozzolans (flyash and slag) in casting beds and panel concrete typically slow the rate of hydration, and may delay or reduce bleed making the casting bed and panel concrete more susceptible to drying shrinkage and increase surface porosity at the time of the SpecTilt application. This increased porosity will require an additional cure coat or bondbreaker coat to achieve adequate hold-out prior to pouring panels. The use of SpecChem "IntraFilm" as a finishing aid will help reduce porosity, and facilitate finishing for denser, tighter slabs.
Curing New Concrete: Ready-to-use. Do not dilute. When used as a cure, SPECTILT 100 QD should be applied immediately after the final steel troweling, after the surface water has disappeared. Waiting too long to apply the cure coat can result in porous, dry casting slabs that will not yield favorable results. The entire slab must be completely covered. When applied on tightly steel troweled concrete, SPECTILT 100 QD meets the moisture retention requirements of ASTM C-309. Typical application for curing is 200-400 sq-ft/gal.
Bondbreaker Coat: Casting slab must be properly cured, smooth, and dense. Remove all dust, dirt, and other contaminants prior to application. SPECTILT 100 QD should be applied just prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels. Spray apply at 400 sq ft per gallon or to the point of rejection. Wait until dry and then apply a second coat at right angles to the previous coat. Coverage rate of second coat is typically 500 - 700 sq ft per gallon. Complete uniform coverage is necessary on casting slab. If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bond breaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet affected areas with water to fill concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply SPECTILT 100 QD. Allow bond breaker to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is thoroughly dry.
Bondbreaker Coat on Old or Water Cured Concrete: Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds or other substances that could adversely affect the performance of SPECTILT 100 QD. The slab must be smooth, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels, flood casting slab surface with clean water. Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply SPECTILT 100 QD to the damp slab to the point of rejection, typically 300 - 500 sq ft per gallon. Allow to dry and then apply a second coat at the same rate but at right angles to the previous coat. Allow to thoroughly dry. As before, if light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary. The application rate can vary greatly depending upon the porosity of the slab and the ambient conditions. Do not under or over apply. It is the contractor''s responsibility to ensure the even presence of SPECTILT 100 QD at the surface of the casting slab prior to pouring concrete. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is thoroughly dry.
Before Pouring Concrete: Verify that the entire treated surface has a dry soap like feel to the touch. Test casting slab by sprinkling a few drops of water in several places. The water should bead up like on a newly waxed car. In hot and/or dry weather, mist or fog the entire slab with water prior to pouring. Avoid scouring the casting slab surface by using a deflection board. Heavy rains or rains prior to bond breaker coats drying may necessitate reapplication.
Stack Panels: Extra care must be used with stack panels as they tend to transfer water across their interface, increasing the possibility of the "osmotic effect" that leads to sticking. It is recommended that SPECTILT 100 QD be applied as the cure coat @ 200-250 sq-ft per gallon prior to the bond breaker coat between each layer to decrease the chance of sticking.
Painting of Panels: If SPECTILT 100 QD has been properly applied and has not been over applied, painting of the panels can be performed as soon as the moisture content in the concrete is at an acceptable level for the paint manufacturer. Coating manufacturer''s instructions for surface preparation and application must be followed and supersedes information in the data sheet.
Other Instructions: Not recommended for use as a bond breaker on broom or rough finished concrete surfaces. Spray apply for best results. Job site conditions can vary greatly. Always ensure the complete presence of bond breaker prior to pouring panels. Please contact SpecChem technical service for special instructions when using concrete mixes containing pozzolans (slag, flyash).', NULL, NULL, 'Store material in the original tightly closed containers.

If treated slab appears uneven or has light colored spots, this may indicate a porous slab that requires additional applications of bond breaker. If after additional applications, these light spots persist, thoroughly wet affected areas with water to fill concrete pores. Squeegee off excess water and then immediately reapply SPECTILT 100. Allow bond breaker to thoroughly dry. An adequate application is indicated only by the presence of a dry soap like feel apparent to the touch over the entire treated slab. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is thoroughly dry.
Bondbreaker Coat on Old or Water Cured Concrete: Verify that the concrete surface is free of curing compounds or other substances that could adversely affect the performance of SPECTILT 100. The slab must be smooth, dense, well cured and clean. Prior to placing reinforcing steel and within two weeks of pouring panels, flood casting slab surface with clean water. Squeegee off excess water and immediately apply SPECTILT 100 to the damp slab to the point of rejection, typically 300 - 500 sq ft per gallon. Allow to dry and then apply a second coat at the same rate but at right angles to the previous coat. Allow to thoroughly dry. As before, if light colored areas appear after drying, a porous slab may be indicated and reapplication will be necessary. The application rate can vary greatly depending upon the porosity of the slab and the ambient conditions. Do not under or over apply. It is the contractor’s responsibility to ensure the even presence of SPECTILT 100 at the surface of the casting slab prior to pouring concrete. Do not allow foot traffic until the slab is thoroughly dry.
Before Pouring Concrete: Verify that the entire treated surface has a dry soap like feel to the touch. Test casting slab by sprinkling a few drops of water in several places. The water should bead up like on a newly waxed car. In hot and/or dry weather, mist or fog the entire slab with water prior to pouring. Avoid scouring the casting slab surface by using a deflection board. Heavy rains or rains prior to bond breaker coats drying may necessitate reapplication.
Stack Panels: Extra care must be used with stack panels as they tend to transfer water across their interface, increasing the possibility of the “osmotic effect” that leads to sticking. It is recommended that SPECTILT 100 be applied as the cure coat @ 200-250 sq-ft per gallon prior to the bond breaker coat between each layer to decrease the chance of sticking.
Painting of Panels: If SPECTILT 100 has been properly applied and has not been over applied, painting of the panels can be performed as soon as the moisture content in the concrete is at an acceptable level for the paint manufacturer. Coating manufacturer’s instructions for surface preparation and application must be followed and supersedes information in the data sheet.
Other Instructions: Not recommended for use as a bond breaker on broom or rough finished concrete surfaces. Spray apply for best results. Job site conditions can vary greatly. Always ensure the complete presence of bond breaker prior to pouring panels. Please contact SpecChem technical service for special instructions when using concrete mixes containing pozzolans (slag, flyash).', NULL, NULL, 'Store material in the original tightly closed containers.

The shelf life of properly stored SPECTILT 100 is two years from the date of manufacture.', 'When spraying SPECTILT 100 keep pressure in pump up sprayers as high as possible to ensure a steady and even spray pattern.
